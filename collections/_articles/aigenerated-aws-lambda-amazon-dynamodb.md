		<h2>Introduction to AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB</h2>
		<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run your code without provisioning and managing servers. On the other hand, Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that can store and retrieve any amount of data, regardless of the data model, and the scale of the request. Both Amazon DynamoDB and AWS Lambda are integral parts of the AWS platform and are widely used by developers to build serverless and scalable applications.  </p>

		<h2>Integration of AWS Lambda with Amazon DynamoDB</h2>
		<p>There are two ways to integrate AWS Lambda with Amazon DynamoDB- through an API or an SDK. The integration allows Lambda to read and write data from and to DynamoDB tables. Developers can use AWS Lambda to trigger a function whenever data is added to or updated in a DynamoDB table. AWS provides a unique feature, DynamoDB Streams, to make data updates available to your AWS Lambda functions.</p>

		<h2>Problems solved by the Integration of AWS Lambda with Amazon DynamoDB</h2>
		<p>The integration of AWS Lambda with Amazon DynamoDB is a powerful tool that can solve several significant problems in your AWS solution, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The integration of AWS Lambda with Amazon DynamoDB can help in scaling database requests according to traffic. DynamoDB scales automatically, making it perfect for serverless and scalable applications that accompany AWS Lambda.</li>
			<li><strong>Ease of Development:</strong> The integration between Amazon DynamoDB and AWS Lambda simplifies the development process, making it easy to add, query, and manipulate data within your AWS solution.</li>
			<li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB are cost-effective solutions that are billed based on usage. AWS Lambda's pay-as-you-go pricing model makes it a cost-effective approach for small tasks running indefinitely.</li>
		</ul>
