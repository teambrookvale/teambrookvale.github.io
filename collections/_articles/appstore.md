    <h4>IDEA</h4>
<p>Before you decide to build a mobile app you should have the answers for the questions below:</p>
<li>What is the problem that I&#8217;m trying to solve?</li>
<li>Who&#8217;s the target market?</li>
<li>What would be the best platform for this idea? Mobile, web or something else?</li>
<li>How will I attract and retain users?</li>
<p>

</p>
<p>After answering these questions the core functions of the app can be determined and a rough ballpark figure for the development cost can be estimated. The exact cost is dependent on complexity and features which can only be concluded after completing the planning &#038; wireframing phase.<br/>
Developing a mobile software is a complicated and expensive project requiring the teamwork of a business analyst, UI designer, UX designer, programmer and project manager. The development cost can be anywhere from $30,000 to $200,000.</p>
<h4>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANNING &#038; WIREFRAMING</h4>
<p>$5,000 &#8211; $15,000 &#8211; 1 &#8211; 2 months</p>
<p>The planning phase involves analysing your idea by taking into account technical details and feasibility. During planning workshops we prepare a wireframing documentation with all functions and screens detailed in depth. A native, working prototype is also prepared which can be shown to potential investors and customers.<br/>
By the end of this stage a development schedule and costing is also prepared.</p>

<h4>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h4>
<p>$30,000 &#8211; $150,000 &#8211; 3 &#8211; 6 months (per platform)</p>
<p>After confirming the wireframing documentation a team of designers and programmers begin to build the mobile app and backend. Development advance test versions are regularly provided to you ensuring transparency and making sure the project stays on track. As a rule of thumb we found that if you calculate with $4,000 per app screen per platform then itâ€™s quite often a good guess.</p>

</p>
<h4>ONGOING COSTS</h4>
<p>$5,000 &#8211; $25,000 &#8211; Annually</p>
<p>Maintaining the application ensures it runs smoothly across all platforms and operating systems. Ongoing costs include server maintenance, bugfixing and dispatching updates.</p>
<h4>ELEMENTS AFFECTING COSTS GREATLY</h4>
<li>Developing for different platforms (iOS, Android, Web, other)</li>
<li>Developing for different devices (iPhone, iPad, Android phones, Android tablets)</li>
<li>Integration with existing enterprise systems</li>
<li>Backend development</li>
<p></p>
<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>The cost of app development is dependent on complexity and features. Simple apps can be developed for $30,000 while complex applications can cost over $150,000. The planning and wireframing phase is essential to determine the timeframe and cost for the project.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind the Team Brookvale formula: $4,000 per screen per platform is generally a good guess.</p>
