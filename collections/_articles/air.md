leadhead: "Air pollution in big cities is a huge problem and with the ever growing number of cars it’s getting worse each year."
leadtext: "Road transport can be responsible for up to 80% pollution in urban areas. To put this in perspective each liter of fuel burnt is issuing up to 2 kg of CO2. If one’s daily average round trip is 20 km that equals roughly 1.5 tonnes of CO2 emission a year."

   <p>Monitoring air quality is essential to provide information to citizens and to propose pollution reducing actions. Pollution monitoring has contributed to the introduction congestion taxes and in turn to a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions in cities such as Stockholm, London or Singapore. </p>
<p>A purpose built circuit board with a gas sensor expansion kit, such as Waspmote, allows to monitor and determine quality of air by the following parameters: CO2, NO2, CO, CH4, H2S, Ethanol, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Toluene, O3</p>

<p>It’s a simple and cost effective IoT solution. With wireless 802.15.4 communication and a battery the board can operate for years reliably. Alarm at a certain threshold can trigger a notification on a mobile device or a computer.</p>
<p>The air pollution IoT device can be completed with a range of other sensors such as UV, temperature, irrigation management, etc. Simple, cost-effective solutions like this helps to have a better understanding</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the mentioned IoT solution or just in general about IoT, do not hesitate to contact us. </p>
