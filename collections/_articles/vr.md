    <p>Each train is equipped with a Hall effect sensor that tracks the revolution of the wheels to determine exactly where on the ride the guests are. A custom software was developed by Team Brookvale which feeds the Hall effect sensor readings to a railway grade Advantech Computer. It transmits the data to the headsets 1,000 times per second via WiFi, working to ensure that the VR story unfolds in a fluid and fully synced way.<br /><br />
    The roller coaster ride is in its testing phase and will be available for the public later this year.<br /><br />
    <i>Note: VR software and Hall effect sensor was developed by other parties.</i>
