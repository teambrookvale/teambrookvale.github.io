			<h2>Integration of Amazon S3 and Magento</h2>
			<p>Amazon S3 and Magento can be integrated through API or SDK. The integration allows Magento to store media files such as images, videos, and other assets in Amazon S3, freeing up valuable server space and bandwidth. This integration also provides better scalability and reliability by storing the assets in the cloud instead of the server.</p>
