<div class="arttext">	<h1>Pardot and ServiceNow Integration</h1>

	<p>Pardot and ServiceNow are two widely used platforms that help businesses in different areas. Pardot is a marketing automation platform that helps with lead generation, email marketing, and more. ServiceNow, on the other hand, is an IT service management platform that helps with IT operations, service management, and incident management.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>Integrating Pardot and ServiceNow can be done through API or SDK. API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of protocols and tools for building software applications. SDK stands for Software Development Kit, which is a set of software development tools that help developers create applications for a specific platform or software.</p>

	<p>The integration of Pardot and ServiceNow using API or SDK enables the exchange of data between the two platforms. This means that when a new lead is generated in Pardot, it can be automatically sent to ServiceNow to create a new incident or service request.</p>

	<h2>Problems Solved by Integration</h2>

	<p>The integration of Pardot and ServiceNow through API or SDK solves two main problems:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Streamline lead to customer conversion:</strong> With this integration, the process of converting a lead to a customer becomes faster and easier. When a new lead is generated, it can be automatically sent to ServiceNow to start the customer onboarding process. This saves time and streamlines the process.</li>

		<li><strong>Improve communication between marketing and IT:</strong> When a new lead is generated, it is important that the IT team is aware of it. Integration between Pardot and ServiceNow ensures that the IT team is notified of new leads, which improves communication and collaboration between the marketing and IT teams.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Integration of Pardot and ServiceNow through API or SDK offers numerous benefits to businesses.
