<div class="arttext">    <h1>LinkedIn Ads and Namely Integration</h1>
    <p>LinkedIn Ads is a powerful tool for businesses to target their audience, reach potential customers, and grow their brand. Namely, on the other hand, is a cloud-based human resources platform that streamlines HR operations for companies.</p>
    <p>Integration of LinkedIn Ads and Namely can help businesses to manage their HR data and advertising campaigns in one place. This integration can be done through API or SDKs provided by both platforms.</p>
    <h2>Problems their integration solves:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Streamlines HR and advertising operations</li>
      <li>Provides a centralized management system</li>
      <li>Reduces manual input and errors</li>
      <li>Improves targeting and advertising ROI</li>
      <li>Helps HR teams to track the status of new hires and candidates in real-time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The API or SDK integration will allow Namely and LinkedIn Ads to communicate with each other, enabling businesses to push HR data (e.g., new hires, terminations, promotions) to the advertising platform and vice versa. For example, when a new employee is hired, the HR team can automatically update their LinkedIn profile and target them with relevant ads to improve their onboarding experience. Similarly, when a candidate progresses to the next stage of the hiring process, the advertising team can target them with personalized ads to keep them engaged.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The integration of LinkedIn Ads and Namely through API or SDKs provides a more seamless experience for HR and advertising teams. By streamlining operations and reducing manual input, it can help businesses to improve their productivity and targeting, leading to better ROI for their advertising campaigns. </p>
