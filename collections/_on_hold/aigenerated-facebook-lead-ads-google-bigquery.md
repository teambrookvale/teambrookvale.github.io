They are an effective way for businesses to generate leads and grow their email list.</p>

  <h2>What is Google BigQuery?</h2>

  <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
  <p>Facebook and Google have provided an API (Application Programming Interface) that enables integration between Facebook Lead Ads and Google BigQuery. The integration allows businesses to automatically send the leads they capture on Facebook to Google BigQuery. This process saves time and eliminates the need for manual data entry.</p>
