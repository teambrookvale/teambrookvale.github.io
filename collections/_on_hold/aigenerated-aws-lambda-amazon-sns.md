<div class="arttext">	<h1>AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS Integration</h1>

	<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud computing platforms offering a wide range of services including AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS. Both of these services offer significant benefits when working with AWS applications and can be integrated together for even more powerful functionality. </p>

	<h2>AWS Lambda</h2>

	<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that enables developers to run code without provisioning or managing any infrastructure. With AWS Lambda, you only pay for the computation time that you consume, making it a cost-effective solution for running small, lightweight applications or performing isolated tasks. This service can be integrated with other AWS services like Amazon SNS for more robust applications.</p>

	<h2>Amazon SNS</h2>

	<p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that enables reliable push notifications to a wide range of devices and platforms. It supports flexible message routing and allows you to use multiple protocols to distribute messages, including SMS, email, HTTP/S, and mobile push notifications. Amazon SNS can be used to trigger events in AWS Lambda, making it a powerful way to provide real-time updates to your applications.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>Integration of AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS can be done through either the API or the Software Development Kit (SDK). The AWS Management Console offers a simple interface for creating and managing topic subscriptions, while the SDK allows you to programmatically create and manage subscriptions within your applications. You can also integrate Amazon SNS with AWS Lambda using AWS CloudFormation, which provides a way to automate the deployment of your resources.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>Integrating AWS Lambda with Amazon SNS solves several problems. Firstly, it allows for faster and more efficient processing of events. Using AWS Lambda with SNS, you can easily scale up or down depending on the volume of events you receive. In addition, it reduces costs associated with using third-party messaging systems, as Amazon SNS is a cost-effective way to send messages and notifications. </p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2> 

	<p>Overall, integrating AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS provides a more robust and efficient way to manage events in your AWS applications. Whether you're building a small application or a large-scale enterprise solution, AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS can help you achieve your goals and streamline your development process. By leveraging the power of the AWS platform, you can create faster, more cost-effective solutions that scale with your business needs.</p>
