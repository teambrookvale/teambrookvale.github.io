<div class="arttext">    <h1>Xero and Namely Integration</h1>

    <p>When it comes to managing your business, having the right tools is essential. Two of the most popular tools for managing finances and HR are Xero and Namely. Xero is a cloud-based accounting software that is designed for small to medium-sized businesses, while Namely is a cloud-based HR software that is designed for mid-sized businesses. Both of these tools are powerful on their own, but when they are integrated, they can create a powerful solution for managing your business.</p>

    <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>

    <p>The integration of Xero and Namely can be done through their respective APIs or SDKs. The APIs allow the two systems to communicate with each other, which means that data can be shared between them. The SDKs provide the tools and resources needed to build custom integrations.</p>

    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

    <p>One of the main problems that the integration of Xero and Namely solves is the need to manually transfer data between the two systems. When the two systems are integrated, data is automatically transferred, which saves time and reduces errors. For example, when an employee is added or updated in Namely, the data is automatically synced with Xero, which means that payroll information is always up to date.</p>

    <p>The integration of Xero and Namely also provides businesses with a complete view of their financial and HR information. This allows businesses to make better decisions based on real-time data. For example, if a business needs to make a hiring decision, they can easily see if they have the budget for it and how it will impact their cash flow.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The integration of Xero and Namely is a powerful solution for managing your business. It saves time, reduces errors, and provides businesses with a complete view of their financial and HR information. Whether you are a small or mid-sized business, integrating Xero and Namely is a smart decision that will help you manage your business more effectively.</p>
