<div class="arttext">    <h1>Integration of Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudFront through API or SDK</h1>
    
    <h2>Amazon EC2</h2>
    <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.</p>
    <p>Amazon EC2 enables businesses to run applications and workloads on virtual machines called instances. Customers have full control over their instances and can access them at any time, from anywhere. </p>
    
    <h2>Amazon CloudFront</h2>
    <p>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally. It integrates with other Amazon Web Services products to give developers and businesses an easy way to distribute content to end-users with low latency, high data transfer speeds, and increased security.</p>
    <p>CloudFront provides services like content delivery, dynamic content acceleration, and origin load balancing. It also offers real-time monitoring and alerts capabilities to better manage and optimize content delivery performance, and help protect against common security threats.</p>
    
    <h2>Integration of Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudFront through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>The integration of Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudFront can be done through an API or SDK. Amazon offers SDKs for different programming languages that developers can use to integrate the two services. </p>
    <p>The Amazon EC2 API allows developers to create, modify, and terminate instances, and to interact with different Amazon Web Services products, including Amazon CloudFront. Developers can use the Amazon CloudFront API to create and manage distributions, and to associate Amazon EC2 instances with a distribution.</p>
    
    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>Integrating Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudFront through API or SDK solves several problems related to content delivery and scalability. </p>
    <p>For example, businesses can use Amazon EC2 to host their applications and databases and Amazon CloudFront to deliver content to end-users. By doing this, businesses can reduce latency, increase data transfer speeds, and improve scalability. Amazon CloudFront can cache content closer to end-users, which reduces the load on Amazon EC2 instances. This ensures that the end-users receive content faster and have a better experience. Additionally, businesses can use Amazon CloudFront to provide additional security by using SSL/TLS certificates to secure the content delivery.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudFront are powerful web services that provide businesses with scalable compute capacity and content delivery capabilities. By integrating these services through API or SDK, businesses can take advantage of their synergies to provide better content delivery performance, and increased security. </p>
    <p>With Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudFront, developers and businesses can create high-performance web applications that can scale to meet the needs of their users.</p>
