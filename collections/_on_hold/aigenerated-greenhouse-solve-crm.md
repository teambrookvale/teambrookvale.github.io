	<p>Greenhouse is a powerful applicant tracking system (ATS) that simplifies the hiring process for companies. It helps companies to manage their recruitment process efficiently and effectively. On the other hand, Solve CRM is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps businesses to manage customer interactions and workflows. By integrating the two through API or SDK, businesses can reap benefits from both systems seamlessly.</p>

With API integration, companies can automatically transfer candidate data from Greenhouse to Solve CRM as soon as a new candidate is added to the ATS. When the candidate is converted to a customer, their data can be transferred from Solve CRM back to Greenhouse.</p>
