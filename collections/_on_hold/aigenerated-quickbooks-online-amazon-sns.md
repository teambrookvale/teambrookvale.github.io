<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integration of QuickBooks Online and Amazon SNS through API</h1>
	
	<p>
		QuickBooks Online is a cloud-based accounting software that is used to manage and track financial transactions, including invoicing, expenses, and payroll. On the other hand, Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service used for distributed applications and microservices. It enables the sending and receiving of messages to and from various distributed computing services, including email, HTTP endpoints, SMS, and mobile apps.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		These two services can be integrated using the API or SDK provided by Amazon. This allows businesses to receive notifications of financial transactions, such as when an invoice is paid or an expense is approved. This integration ensures that the business can keep track of all transactions and manage their finances efficiently.
