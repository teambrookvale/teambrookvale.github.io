        <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
        <p>Amazon provides an SDK (Software Development Kit) for developers to integrate S3 with their applications. Magento 2 also comes with a robust set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable developers to build custom integrations with other systems. By using S3 and Magento 2 together, developers can store and retrieve product images, video files, customer data, and more in the cloud and make them accessible to the Magento-powered website or mobile app.</p>
