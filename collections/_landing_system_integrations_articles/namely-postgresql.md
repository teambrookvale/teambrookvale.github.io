<div class="arttext">    <h1>Namely and PostgreSQL Integration</h1>
    <p>Namely is a Human Resource Management (HRM) platform that is aimed at small and medium-sized businesses. PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is an open-source relational database management system. These two systems can be integrated to work together using an Application Programming Interface (API) or a Software Development Kit (SDK).</p>
    <h2>API or SDK Integration</h2>
    <p>Integrating Namely and PostgreSQL can be done through an API or SDK. The API integration gives more control over the data flow between the two systems. This allows data to flow seamlessly between the two, which means that data entered into Namely can be automatically updated into PostgreSQL without requiring any manual intervention. On the other hand, the SDK integration is more customizable and allows users to have more control over how data from Namely is transferred to PostgreSQL.</p>
    <h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>
    <p>The integration of Namely and PostgreSQL solves the problem of having multiple disjointed systems in an organization since cross-functional data exchange can be automatically done without any direct manual intervention. With the integration, data entered into Namely can automatically be updated in the PostgreSQL database, including employee information/records (payroll, time and attendance records, benefits, etc.), ensuring accurate and timely data across the board.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The integration of Namely and PostgreSQL is an excellent solution for companies, particularly small and medium-sized organizations, to ensure that their HR and database management needs can be seamlessly integrated. The API or SDK integration ensures that cross-functional data exchange between the two systems is automatic and highly accurate. Ultimately, this makes data management simpler, ensuring more efficient operations for organizations. </p>
