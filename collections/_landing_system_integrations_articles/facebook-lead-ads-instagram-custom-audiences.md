    <h2>Facebook Lead Ads</h2>
    <p>Facebook Lead Ads are a type of Facebook ad format that lets you capture leads without a user ever leaving Facebook.

The aim of these ads is to provide a seamless and convenient way for users to share their contact information with businesses.</p>
    
    <h2>Instagram Custom Audiences</h2>
    <p>Instagram Custom Audiences allows businesses to use their customer data to find their existing customers on Instagram. This means that businesses can use their customer lists, website traffic data, or app activity data to create Custom Audiences. By targeting these audiences, businesses can reach their existing customers with personalized messages on Instagram.</p>
    
    <h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>
