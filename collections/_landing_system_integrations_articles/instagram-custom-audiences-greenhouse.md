	<h1>How Instagram Custom Audiences Can Be Integrated with Greenhouse</h1>

	<p>
		Instagram Custom Audiences is a powerful tool for reaching individuals who have already shown interest in your brand. Greenhouse, on the other hand, is a popular applicant tracking system used by many businesses. By integrating the two through API or SDK, businesses can streamline their recruitment process and reach a wider pool of qualified candidates. 
	</p>

	<h2>Instagram Custom Audiences</h2>

	<p>
		Instagram Custom Audiences is a feature that allows businesses to target their ads to specific groups of people. This is done by uploading a list of email addresses, phone numbers, or Instagram user IDs to create a custom audience. Once the custom audience is created, businesses can create ads that will only be shown to individuals who are a part of that audience. This feature is especially useful for retargeting individuals who have already engaged with your brand in some way, such as through a website visit or previous purchase.

	<h2>Greenhouse</h2>

	<p>
		Greenhouse is an applicant tracking system that helps businesses manage their recruitment process. With Greenhouse, businesses can create job postings, receive applications and resumes, and track candidates through the hiring process. Greenhouse also offers tools for scheduling interviews and communicating with candidates. 
	</p>

	<h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>
		By integrating Instagram Custom Audiences with Greenhouse through API or SDK, businesses can take advantage of the power of both tools to streamline their hiring process. For example, a business could create a custom audience from a list of email addresses collected through the Greenhouse system. They could then create job postings that target candidates who are a part of that custom audience. This would ensure that the job posting is being seen by individuals who have already shown interest in the brand. 
	</p>

	<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>

	<p>
		Integrating Instagram Custom Audiences with Greenhouse solves several problems for businesses. First, it allows businesses to reach a wider pool of qualified candidates by targeting individuals who have already engaged with the brand. This can help to increase the quality of candidates who apply for open positions. Second, it streamlines the recruitment process by allowing businesses to manage all aspects of hiring in one platform. This saves time and reduces the risk of miscommunication between different tools and systems. 
	</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>
		By integrating Instagram Custom Audiences with Greenhouse through API or SDK, businesses can take advantage of the best features of both tools. This integration streamlines the recruitment process and allows businesses to reach a wider pool of qualified candidates. If you're not already using both tools, it's definitely worth considering how they could work together to benefit your business.
