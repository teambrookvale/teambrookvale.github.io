<div class="arttext">	<h1>ServiceNow and Xero Integration</h1>
	<p>ServiceNow and Xero are two powerful business management tools that can greatly benefit any organization. ServiceNow is an IT service management platform, while Xero is an accounting software that provides online invoicing, billing, and banking.
