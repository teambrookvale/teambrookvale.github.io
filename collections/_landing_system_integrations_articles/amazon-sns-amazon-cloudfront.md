CloudFront also has support for custom SSL certificates and access logs.</p>

	<p>Amazon SNS and CloudFront can be integrated through an API or an SDK. This integration allows businesses to use SNS to send notifications to CloudFront, which can then distribute the notifications to the appropriate endpoints. The API or SDK makes it easy for businesses to set up their integration and send messages quickly and efficiently.</p>
