<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integration of Facebook Lead Ads and Amazon Polly</h1>

	<p>Facebook Lead Ads is a powerful tool that allows businesses to collect lead information from users through a form directly on the platform. Amazon Polly, on the other hand, is an advanced text-to-speech service that turns written content into lifelike speech in various languages and voices.</p>

	<p>By integrating the two through an API or SDK, businesses can take their marketing efforts to the next level. The integration enables the creation of automated voice messages that immediately engage and close potential customers as soon as they submit a form on Facebook. Amazon Polly allows businesses to create custom voice recordings with natural-sounding voices, which can add a personal touch to their marketing efforts and help to build customer relationships.</p>
