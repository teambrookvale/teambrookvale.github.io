		<h1>How Marketo and Greenhouse Integration Benefits Marketing and HR Teams</h1>
		<p>In today's digital age, it is common for businesses to use multiple software solutions to handle their respective departments. For instance, companies would use a marketing automation software like Marketo and an applicant tracking system like Greenhouse to streamline their sales and HR processes, respectively. However, managing these platforms separately entails manually transferring data from one tool to another, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Thankfully, Marketo and Greenhouse have an API and SDK integration that enables seamless communication between the two platforms.</p>

		<h3>3. Enhanced Collaboration Between Departments</h3>
