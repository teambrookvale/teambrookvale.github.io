    <h2>What is Zoho CRM?</h2>

    <h2>What is MySQL?</h2>
    <p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that is widely used for web applications. It is a popular choice for developers because it is fast, reliable, and easy to use. MySQL is used by businesses of all sizes for storing and managing data such as customer information, product details, and sales data. It is a critical tool for many businesses and is essential for managing their operations.</p>

    <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>Integrating Zoho CRM and MySQL can be done through either the Zoho CRM API or an SDK. Both options allow businesses to connect the two platforms and enable sharing of data between the two systems.

One of the main benefits of integration is that it provides businesses with a single source of truth for their data. Rather than having to manually transfer data between the two systems, integration enables data to be shared automatically, ensuring that it is up to date and accurate.</p>

    <p>Another benefit of integration is that it enables businesses to streamline their operations. With data synced between the two systems, businesses can automate many tasks, such as updating customer records or generating sales reports. This automation saves time and reduces the risk of errors, enabling businesses to focus on more strategic tasks.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
