<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Amazon Polly with PostgreSQL</h1>
	<p>Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service provided by Amazon Web Services. PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system. These two technologies can be integrated through API or SDK, providing a seamless experience for text-to-speech applications.</p>

	<h2>Integration of Amazon Polly and PostgreSQL through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>Amazon Polly has a RESTful API that allows developers to interact with the service programmatically. PostgreSQL can be accessed through various programming languages such as Python and Java. By using these languages and the appropriate SDKs, developers can integrate Amazon Polly and PostgreSQL.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>By integrating Amazon Polly and PostgreSQL, developers can build intelligent text-to-speech applications that can store and retrieve speech files from the database. This enables applications to scale easily and efficiently, as well as improving the user experience by delivering dynamic and personalized audio experiences.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Integrating Amazon Polly with PostgreSQL provides developers with a powerful toolset to build intelligent text-to-speech applications. The integration through API or SDK unlocks scalability and efficiency, while improving the user experience. Developers can leverage the power of these two technologies to build high-quality speech applications that are customer-centric and modern. </p>
