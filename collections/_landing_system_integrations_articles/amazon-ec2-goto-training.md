			<h2>What is Amazon EC2?</h2>
			<p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, commonly known as Amazon EC2, is a web service that provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud. It allows businesses to deploy and manage applications without investing heavily in physical infrastructure. Users can create virtual machines within minutes, and scale their capacity up or down as per their needs.</p>

			<h2>What is GoTo Training?</h2>
			<p>GoTo Training is a cloud-based platform that enables businesses to deliver interactive online training sessions to their learners. It allows trainers to create and host virtual classrooms, where learners can participate in real-time sessions from their own devices. The platform also offers tools for testing and tracking learners' progress to make sure they're meeting their learning objectives.</p>

			<h2>Integrating Amazon EC2 and GoTo Training</h2>
			<p>By integrating Amazon EC2 and GoTo Training, businesses can enjoy a seamless collaboration between their cloud infrastructure and their virtual training sessions. This can be achieved through the use of API or SDK.</p>
			<p>With API integration, businesses can automate the process of creating virtual machines in Amazon EC2 instances whenever a new training session is scheduled on GoTo Training. This ensures that there's enough computing capacity to handle the virtual classroom, eliminating the risk of downtime or slow performance due to insufficient resources.</p>
			<p>SDK integration, on the other hand, allows trainers to easily access their Amazon EC2 instances through the GoTo Training platform. They can manage their virtual machines and workspaces from within the virtual classroom environment, without having to switch between different interfaces or tools.</p>
