<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integration of BigCommerce and ServiceNow</h1>

	<p>BigCommerce is a powerful e-commerce platform that allows businesses to create and run online stores. ServiceNow, on the other hand, is a cloud-based IT service management platform that helps businesses automate their IT processes. These two platforms are quite different, but they can be integrated to provide businesses with a more comprehensive solution.</p>

	<p>The integration of BigCommerce and ServiceNow can be achieved through the use of APIs or SDKs. These tools allow the two platforms to communicate with each other, exchanging data and information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.</p>

	<p>One of the main problems that this integration solves is the lack of visibility into the customer order experience. Without this integration, businesses may not be able to track customer orders as they move through the various stages of the order process. This could result in delays and mistakes, which can damage the customer experience and ultimately lead to lost sales.</p>

	<p>Another problem that this integration solves is the lack of automation in the order fulfillment process. With the integration of BigCommerce and ServiceNow, businesses can automatically create tasks, such as shipping labels and order confirmations. This can save time and reduce errors, which can ultimately improve the customer experience.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of BigCommerce and ServiceNow is a powerful solution for businesses looking to improve their online stores and automate their IT processes. With the ability to exchange data and automate tasks, businesses can save time and improve the customer experience. If you're considering integrating these two platforms, be sure to explore the APIs and SDKs available to you and consult with experts who can help you make the most of this integration.</p>
