    <p>
      Have you ever wished to enhance your database with text-to-speech capabilities? Amazon Polly and MySQL integration can make your wish come true. Amazon Polly is a cloud service that converts text to lifelike speech, while MySQL is an open-source relational database that is widely used by developers worldwide. Here is how they can be integrated.
    </p>
    <h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>
      Amazon Polly provides a software development kit (SDK) and a RESTful API that developers can use to access its services. To integrate Amazon Polly with MySQL, you can use one of these options. For instance, you can write a script that retrieves the text from a MySQL database, sends it to Amazon Polly via its API, and saves the resulting speech in another directory or table. Similarly, you can use an SDK to add text-to-speech functionality to your MySQL-powered web or mobile application.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>
      By integrating Amazon Polly and MySQL, you can solve various problems related to accessibility, personalization, and automation. For example, you can create an audio version of your website or app content to cater to users with visual impairments or reading difficulties. You can also customize the speech style, language, and gender to match your users' preferences or context. Additionally, you can automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks such as reading long reports or manuals and focus on more important work.
