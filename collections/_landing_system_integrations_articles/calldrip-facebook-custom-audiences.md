<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Calldrip and Facebook Custom Audiences</h1>
	<p>Both Calldrip and Facebook Custom Audiences are powerful tools for businesses. Calldrip is a lead response software that helps companies respond to inbound phone leads quickly and efficiently. Facebook Custom Audiences, on the other hand, allows businesses to target specific groups of people on Facebook with their ads.</p>
	<p>By integrating the two, businesses can take advantage of the best of both worlds.</p>
	<h2>API or SDK Integration</h2>
	<p>There are different ways to integrate Calldrip and Facebook Custom Audiences. One of the most popular methods is through API or SDK.</p>
	<p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software and applications. An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of software development tools that allow developers to create applications for a specific platform.</p>
	<p>By using the API or SDK, developers can create custom integrations that allow Calldrip and Facebook Custom Audiences to work seamlessly together.</p>

By responding quickly to inbound phone leads and then targeting those leads with ads on Facebook, businesses can stay top-of-mind and move potential customers closer to a purchase decision.
