	<p>When it comes to managing customer relationship and human resource, businesses are constantly looking for ways to streamline their processes and improve efficiency. However, managing these two crucial aspects of a business can pose significant challenges if the systems are not integrated.</p>

In this article, we will discuss how the two platforms integrate through API or SDK and the benefits of their integration.</p>

	<h2>Integration of Solve CRM and BambooHR</h2>

	<p>The integration of Solve CRM and BambooHR can be achieved through API or SDK. With API integration, you can seamlessly connect the two platforms and share data between them.
