<div class="arttext">	<h1>Facebook Lead Ads and Greenhouse Integration</h1>
	<p>Marketing teams and recruiters often use different software to capture leads and find potential candidates for their respective organizations. However, the integration of Facebook Lead Ads and Greenhouse resolves some of the problems caused by using separate platforms.</p>

	<h2>Facebook Lead Ads</h2>
	<p>Facebook Lead Ads are a type of ad campaign that allows businesses to capture lead information directly within Facebook. When a user clicks on the ad, a form pops up with their pre-filled Facebook information. This makes it easier for users to submit their information, and it's also important to note that Facebook Lead Ads have a higher conversion rate compared to regular ads that redirect users to a landing page. </p>

	<h2>Greenhouse</h2>
	<p>Greenhouse is a recruiting and hiring platform that enables recruiters to manage job postings, applicant tracking, and interview scheduling. It helps teams with candidate engagement and customizable recruiting workflows. </p>

	<h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>The integration of Facebook Lead Ads and Greenhouse can be done through API or SDK. With API integration, the lead information collected through Facebook Lead Ads can be automatically synced to the Greenhouse ATS (Applicant Tracking System), and recruiters can access the information for follow-up. The SDK integration, on the other hand, allows recruiters to view and manage lead information within Facebook Ads Manager. </p>

	<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>
	<p>With Facebook Lead Ads and Greenhouse integration, marketing teams and recruiters can work seamlessly together. The integration solves the problem of manually exporting lead data from one platform and importing it into the other. It helps streamline lead generation and hiring processes, making it quicker and easier for teams to convert leads and fill job positions. </p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Using Facebook Lead Ads and Greenhouse integration can benefit businesses of all sizes. It's a powerful solution that helps increase productivity and improves lead generation and recruitment efforts. It enables better collaboration between marketing and recruiting teams, leading to better results. </p>
