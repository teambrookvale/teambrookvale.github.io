<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Amazon CloudFront and Chargify</h1>

	<p>Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers all around the world. On the other hand, Chargify is a subscription management and recurring billing platform that helps businesses manage their billing and subscription needs. These two services can be integrated together using APIs or SDKs, which can solve a lot of problems for businesses that rely on online content delivery and recurring billing.</p>

	<h2>Integration of Amazon CloudFront and Chargify through API or SDK</h2>

Amazon CloudFront provides APIs that allow you to programmatically manage your content delivery network. You can configure and monitor your distribution, update your cache settings, and even delete your distribution using the API. On the other hand, Chargify provides a developer center that offers SDKs and APIs that can be used to integrate your billing system with your application or website.</p>

	<p>To integrate Amazon CloudFront and Chargify, you can create a custom integration that maps Chargify plans to CloudFront behaviors. You can also use webhooks to notify your application whenever customers subscribe, unsubscribe, or update their billing information. This way, your content delivery system can dynamically adjust to changes in your customer's subscription status.</p>
