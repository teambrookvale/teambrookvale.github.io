For example, Pardot provides a RESTful API that allows third-party applications to interact with its platform. With the API, businesses can create, read, update, and delete leads and prospects in Pardot. MySQL can also be used to create and manage databases that store lead and prospect information. By integrating the two tools, businesses can easily store and manage lead and prospect data in a centralized location.</p>
