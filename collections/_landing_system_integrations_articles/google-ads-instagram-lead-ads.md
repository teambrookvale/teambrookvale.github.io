		<h2>Google Ads</h2>

With Google Ads, businesses can target specific keywords, demographics, and behaviors to ensure their ads reach the right audience.</p>

		<h2>Instagram Lead Ads</h2>
		<p>Instagram Lead Ads is a feature within the Instagram platform that allows businesses to collect contact information from potential customers directly from the Instagram app. With Lead Ads, businesses can create customized forms that appear within the Instagram app, allowing users to submit their contact information without leaving the app. This makes it easier for businesses to generate leads and build their customer database.</p>

		<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
		<p>Google Ads and Instagram Lead Ads can be integrated through API or SDK. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of programming instructions that allows the two platforms to communicate with each other. SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software development tools that can be used to create applications for a specific software package. By integrating Google Ads and Instagram Lead Ads, businesses can synchronize their marketing campaigns across both platforms, ensuring their ads reach a wider audience and generating more leads.</p>

		</ul>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
