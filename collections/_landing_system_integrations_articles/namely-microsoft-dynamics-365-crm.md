<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Namely and Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM</h1>

	<p>Namely is a cloud-based HR software that streamlines various HR processes. On the other hand, Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM is a customer relationship management solution aimed at helping organizations improve their sales and marketing processes.</p>

	<p>Integrating Namely and Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM through API or SDK brings a lot of benefits to organizations. For one, it helps bridge the gap between HR and sales/marketing teams. With both systems integrated, it becomes easy for sales and marketing reps to access critical employee information like job titles, performance reviews, and other relevant data. This information can then be used to customize communication with prospects and customers, making it more personalized and therefore effective.</p>

	<p>The integration also eliminates data duplication. Without integration, organizations might have to manually enter employee information like job titles, contact information, etc., into both systems. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. However, through API or SDK, this process is simplified, and data can be entered into one system, and it automatically syncs with the other system. This saves time and reduces errors since there is no manual entry of data.</p>

	<p>Finally, integrating Namely and Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM helps to improve data accuracy. When data is manually entered into each system, there is a high likelihood that data inconsistencies will occur. Inconsistencies cause confusion and make it difficult for teams to trust data and use it to make critical decisions. However, when both systems are integrated, data flows seamlessly, and teams can trust the accuracy of the data.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of Namely and Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM through API or SDK helps organizations to streamline their HR and sales/marketing processes while also improving data accuracy. It eliminates data duplication and data inconsistencies while making it easier for sales reps to personalize communication with prospects and customers. Organizations that have not yet integrated these systems should consider doing so to take advantage of these benefits.</p>
