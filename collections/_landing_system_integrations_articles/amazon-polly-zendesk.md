<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Amazon Polly and Zendesk: Solving Customer Support Problems</h1>
	
	<p>Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables developers to add lifelike speech to their applications. Zendesk is a popular customer support platform that helps businesses manage their customer service interactions. Together, they can provide a powerful solution to common customer support problems.</p>
	
	<h2>Integration of Amazon Polly and Zendesk</h2>
	
	<p>The integration of Amazon Polly and Zendesk can be achieved through either API or SDK. By using API, developers can directly call the Polly service from their Zendesk application to generate speech from text. On the other hand, using SDK allows developers to add the Polly service to their application as a library, making it easier to integrate the two platforms.</p>
	
	<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>
	
	<p>The integration of Amazon Polly and Zendesk can solve a number of common customer support problems, including:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Language Barriers: With Amazon Polly, businesses can generate spoken content in multiple languages, which can help overcome language barriers while providing support to customers around the world.</li>
		<li>Accessibility: For customers with disabilities, speech-to-text capabilities can be a lifesaver. By integrating Polly, customer support can accommodate the needs of customers with disabilities, ensuring they receive equal access to support services.</li>
		<li>Text Complexity: Not all customers may be skilled at reading or have the time to read complex support documentation. By using Amazon Polly, support teams can provide audio guidance or explanations for technical problems, or any other complex issues which can make customer experience more satisfying.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>By integrating Amazon Polly to Zendesk, businesses can enhance their customer support capabilities, improve accessibility, and overcome language barriers. Using the integration, support teams can provide audio guidance or explanations to multiple languages, reducing text complexity and making customer support all around much better and effective.
