<div class="arttext">    <h1>Integrating ServiceNow and Amazon Polly</h1>
    <p>ServiceNow is an enterprise software platform that helps businesses manage workflow, automate processes, and improve customer service. Amazon Polly, on the other hand, is a text-to-speech service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to generate human-like speech from text.</p>

    <h2>API or SDK integration</h2>
    <p>The integration of ServiceNow and Amazon Polly can be done through API or SDK. With API integration, ServiceNow can make calls to Polly to generate speech from text in ServiceNow records. With SDK integration, ServiceNow developers can use Amazon Polly SDK for Java or Python to create custom applications that can generate speech from text in real-time.</p>

    <h2>Solving problems with integration</h2>
    <p>Integrating ServiceNow and Amazon Polly can solve many problems for businesses. Firstly, it can help automate customer service operations. For instance, ServiceNow can use Polly to generate automated voice responses to customer queries, saving time and resources.</p>
    <p>Secondly, the integration can help improve accessibility for people with disabilities. Polly can generate speech from text for visually impaired users, helping them access information in ServiceNow records.</p>
    <p>Finally, the integration can help businesses in the field of e-learning. Educational institutions can use Polly to generate voice-overs for instructional videos and other learning materials in ServiceNow.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The integration of ServiceNow and Amazon Polly through API or SDK can deliver many benefits to businesses, including improving customer service operations, enhancing accessibility, and helping in e-learning. ServiceNow developers can use Amazon Polly SDK to create custom applications that generate speech from text in real-time, while ServiceNow records can be integrated with Polly through API calls. By integrating the two, businesses can save time, reduce costs, and improve the overall user experience.</p>
