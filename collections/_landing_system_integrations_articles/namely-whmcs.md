<div class="arttext">    <h1>Integrating Namely with WHMCS using API or SDK</h1>

    <p>
        Namely is a powerful HR software that helps companies streamline their HR operations. WHMCS, on the other hand, is an all-in-one client management, billing, and support solution for web hosting providers. By integrating the two, it's possible to create a seamless experience for managing employees and billing clients.
    </p>

    <h2>API or SDK?</h2>

    <p>
        There are two approaches to integrating Namely with WHMCS: using an API or an SDK. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools for building software applications. An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of development tools that allow developers to create applications for a certain software package or hardware platform. Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to consider which one is the best fit for your use case.
