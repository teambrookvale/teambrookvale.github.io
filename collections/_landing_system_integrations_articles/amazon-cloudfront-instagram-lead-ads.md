    <h2>Instagram Lead Ads</h2>
    <p>Instagram Lead Ads are a type of ad format offered by Instagram that allows businesses to collect user information (such as name, email address, phone number) within the app. When a user clicks on a lead ad, a pre-populated form opens that allows them to submit their information without leaving the app.</p>
