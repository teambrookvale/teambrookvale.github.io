<div class="arttext">	<h1>Namely and Marketo Integration: A Match Made in Heaven</h1>
	<p>When it comes to managing human resources and marketing automation, Namely and Marketo are two powerful tools that businesses can utilize to streamline their operations.</p>

	<h2>The Power of Namely</h2>
	<p>Namely is a cloud-based platform that helps businesses manage their HR needs, from onboarding to payroll to performance management. With Namely, companies can automate their HR processes, giving them more time to focus on other aspects of their business. Namely's user-friendly interface and intuitive features make it an ideal solution for businesses of all sizes, from small startups to large enterprises.</p>

	<h2>The Power of Marketo</h2>
	<p>Marketo, on the other hand, is a marketing automation platform that helps businesses attract, engage, and delight their customers. With Marketo, companies can create and execute personalized marketing campaigns, track their performance, and generate leads. Marketo's powerful features, such as lead scoring and segmentation, make it a valuable tool for businesses looking to improve their marketing efforts.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>By integrating Namely and Marketo through their API or SDK, businesses can enjoy the benefits of both platforms and improve their overall operations. Through the integration, employee data from Namely can be synced with Marketo, allowing companies to target their marketing campaigns based on employee information such as job title, location, and department.</p>

	<h2>The Problems the Integration Solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of Namely and Marketo solves several problems that businesses face when managing both HR and marketing automation.
