<div class="arttext">	<h1>Calldrip and GoToWebinar Integration</h1>

	<p>Calldrip and GoToWebinar are two powerful tools that can help businesses in their sales and marketing efforts. Calldrip is a lead management and sales acceleration software that allows sales teams to immediately follow up with leads via phone calls while they are still hot. On the other hand, GoToWebinar is a webinar platform that lets businesses educate and engage with their audience in real time.</p>

	<p>By integrating Calldrip with GoToWebinar through an API or SDK, businesses can further enhance their sales and marketing efforts. With this integration, lead information gathered during webinars through GoToWebinar can be automatically sent to Calldrip, where sales teams can take immediate action and follow up with leads right away.</p>

	<p>One of the problems solved by this integration is the speed of lead follow-up. According to research, the chance of converting a lead decreases significantly if the follow-up takes longer than five minutes. By connecting GoToWebinar to Calldrip, businesses can ensure that leads are followed up with right after their engagement with the business, increasing their chances of conversion.</p>

	<p>Another issue solved by this integration is the efficiency of lead management. By automating the process of passing lead information from GoToWebinar to Calldrip, sales teams can focus on other important aspects of the sales process rather than manually entering lead information into the system.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of Calldrip and GoToWebinar through API or SDK is an excellent way for businesses to improve their sales and marketing efforts. By enabling quick follow-up with leads and automating lead management processes, businesses can increase their chances of converting leads into customers. </p>
