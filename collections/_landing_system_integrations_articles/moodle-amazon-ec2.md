  <h2>Integration of Moodle and Amazon EC2</h2>
  <p>The integration of Moodle and Amazon EC2 can be achieved through the use of API or SDK. API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications, while SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of software development tools that allow developers to create applications for a specific platform.</p>
  
  <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
  <p>The integration of Moodle and Amazon EC2 solves several problems for institutions and businesses that use both platforms. First, it enables institutions to scale their digital learning resources, both in terms of performance and storage, to meet the growing demand for online content. Second, it allows institutions to reduce their IT infrastructure costs by leveraging the cost-effective cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon EC2. Third, it provides institutions with the flexibility to choose the best hardware and software resources for their digital learning needs.</p>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The integration of Moodle and Amazon EC2 is a powerful combination that enables institutions and businesses to create and share digital learning resources at scale. With the flexibility and cost-effectiveness provided by Amazon EC2, coupled with the robustness of Moodle, the integration of the two platforms is a win-win situation for all stakeholders. </p>
