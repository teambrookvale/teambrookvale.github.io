<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Facebook Custom Audiences with Zendesk</h1>
	
	<p>Facebook Custom Audiences is a powerful tool for reaching a targeted audience of potential customers. It allows businesses to upload a list of email addresses or phone numbers and target ads towards those specific individuals. Zendesk, on the other hand, is a customer support platform that helps businesses provide excellent customer service.</p>
	
	<p>Integrating the two platforms through API or SDK can bring numerous benefits to the table. One such benefit is the ability to create highly personalized and targeted ads that are based on a customer's support history. This can help businesses improve conversions and lower their customer acquisition costs.</p>
	
	<p>Add to that, businesses can use this integration to create targeted ads for customers requesting support or for those who have been recently helped by a customer support team. This kind of targeted advertising can help bridge the gap between support and marketing departments, leading to a more cohesive customer experience.</p>
	
	<p>Another problem that this integration solves is enhancing the customer support experience. Businesses can create a more personalized and efficient customer support experience by leveraging Custom Audiences insights. For example, if a customer is experiencing an issue with a product, businesses can use the Custom Audiences data to identify if that customer is among their most valuable customers. Then, businesses can use that insight to prioritize their support requests and provide more personalized solutions.</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	
	<p>Integrating Facebook Custom Audiences with Zendesk can be a game-changer for businesses. This integration opens up new possibilities for personalization and targeted marketing while enhancing the customer support experience. By utilizing this integration, businesses can streamline workflows and provide customers with better service across the board.</p>
