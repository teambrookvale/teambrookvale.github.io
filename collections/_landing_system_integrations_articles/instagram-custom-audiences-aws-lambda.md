<div class="arttext">	<h1>Instagram Custom Audiences Integration with AWS Lambda</h1>
	<p>Instagram Custom Audiences is a feature offered by Instagram that allows businesses to create target audience groups made up of people who have already interacted with their brand in some way. This can include people who have visited the business’s website, engaged with their social media content, or made a purchase.</p>
	<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service offered by Amazon Web Services. It allows businesses to run code in response to events without having to manage servers or infrastructure. </p>
	<p>The two can be integrated through the use of an API or SDK. This integration allows businesses to automatically update their custom audiences on Instagram based on a variety of different triggers. For example, if someone makes a purchase on a business’s website, Lambda could update the custom audience to include that person, allowing the business to target them with future advertising campaigns.</p>
	<p>This integration solves several problems for businesses. First, it allows them to easily keep their custom audiences up to date, without having to manually update their lists. This saves businesses time and ensures that their advertising campaigns are reaching the right people. It also allows businesses to target their advertising more effectively, by only showing ads to people who have already interacted with their brand in some way. This can lead to higher conversion rates and lower advertising costs.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Instagram Custom Audiences with AWS Lambda is a powerful tool for businesses looking to improve the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. By automating the process of updating custom audiences, businesses can save time and target their advertising more effectively. This integration is easy to set up and can be done through the use of an API or SDK.</p>
