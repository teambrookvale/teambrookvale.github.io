	<h1>Integrating Facebook Custom Audiences and Xero - Solving Business Problems</h1>

	<p>Facebook has become an essential part of any business’ marketing strategy. With over two billion monthly active users, it offers an enormous potential audience that businesses can target. However, trying to market to the right people is a challenge. That's where Facebook Custom Audiences come in. Custom Audiences allow businesses to target specific groups of people based on their interests and behaviors.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, Xero is a cloud-based accounting software solution that helps businesses manage their finances. By offering an affordable alternative to traditional accounting, Xero has become a favorite of many small businesses.</p>

	<p>When combined, Facebook Custom Audiences and Xero can create a powerful tool for a business. By integrating through an API or SDK, businesses can use Custom Audiences to target specific groups of people based on financial data. For instance, a business can use Custom Audiences to target people who have recently made a purchase, or target people who have recently opened a new bank account.</p>

	<p>The integration of the two platforms provides several benefits for businesses. First, businesses can create highly-targeted ad campaigns that are more likely to reach their intended audience. This results in a higher conversion rate for the ads. Additionally, businesses can use financial data to better understand their customers’ needs and preferences. By having access to this information, they can tailor their marketing efforts to better meet those needs.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of Facebook Custom Audiences and Xero allows businesses to create highly-targeted ad campaigns that deliver better results. By leveraging financial data, businesses can better understand their customers and tailor their marketing efforts to meet their needs. As a result, businesses can increase their ROI and grow their customer base.</p>
