	<h1>Integrating Namely and Greenhouse</h1>

	<p>Namely is an HR management software that aligns with the needs of modern businesses. Its features include HR administration, taxes, and benefits. On the other hand, Greenhouse is an applicant tracking system (ATS) used by recruiters and companies to manage their recruitment process. Both tools are essential for an organization.</p>

	<p>The integration of Namely and Greenhouse through an API or SDK allows for a seamless exchange of data, automating several HR processes. The integration saves time and effort for HR professionals, allowing them to focus on strategic tasks instead of administrative work.</p>

	<p>Through the integration, several problems are solved, including:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Streamlined data management:</strong> HR data and candidate information are shared between the two platforms in real-time, minimizing the chance of errors and duplicate data entry.</li>
		<li><strong>Better candidate experience:</strong> Candidates' data from Greenhouse can be transferred to Namely to initiate the onboarding process proactively.</li>
		<li><strong>Improved HR procedures:</strong> The integration provides HR professionals with a comprehensive view of the recruitment process, enabling them to track and manage HR procedures more efficiently.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Using API or SDK?</h2>

	<p>The integration can be done through an application programming interface (API) or a software development kit (SDK). Developers can use API or SDK to link the two tools, enabling them to communicate with each other.</p>

	<p>API is a program that allows two applications to communicate with each other. It defines the rules that the applications follow to interact with each other. Namely and Greenhouse provide REST APIs that make it easy for developers to integrate the two platforms.</p>

	<p>SDK, on the other hand, is a set of tools that simplify the process of integrating two systems. It provides developers with libraries, APIs, and other tools that make it easier to achieve the integration between the two systems. Greenhouse provides a Javascript SDK that makes it easier for developers to integrate the two platforms.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of Namely and Greenhouse through API or SDK provides companies with a more productive and efficient recruitment process. The integration facilitates data exchange between the two platforms, allowing HR professionals to focus on strategic tasks. Through the integration, businesses can streamline their HR processes, provide a better candidate experience, and manage activities efficiently.</p>
