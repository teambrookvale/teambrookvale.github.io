    <p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work.</p>
    
    <p>Zendesk is a cloud-based customer service software designed to help businesses of all sizes manage customer relationships across multiple channels such as email, chat, phone, and social media. It provides a unified customer experience while reducing customer support costs and increasing agent productivity.</p>
    
    <p>Integrating Amazon SQS and Zendesk through API or SDK allows businesses to automate the process of creating support tickets for customer inquiries received through different channels. With this integration, the messages received through SQS can be pushed to Zendesk, thereby converting them into support tickets. This not only saves businesses time and effort but also ensures that customer inquiries are addressed in a timely manner.</p>
    
    <p>Moreover, businesses can monitor their support team's performance and track metrics such as average response time and resolution time using Zendesk's reporting tools. This can help businesses identify opportunities to improve customer support and address any bottlenecks in the ticket resolution process.</p>
