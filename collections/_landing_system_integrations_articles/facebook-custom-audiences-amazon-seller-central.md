Luckily, there are tools like Facebook Custom Audiences and Amazon Seller Central that can help you achieve both of these goals. But have you ever considered integrating the two? Here's why you should:</p>

	<h2>Facebook Custom Audiences</h2>

	<p>Facebook Custom Audiences is a powerful tool that allows you to create Facebook ads targeted at people who have already shown interest in your brand or products. You can upload a list of email addresses, phone numbers, or Facebook user IDs and Facebook will match them to existing profiles. This way, you can serve ads to people who are already familiar with your brand, and increase the likelihood of conversions.</p>

	<h2>Amazon Seller Central</h2>

	<p>Amazon Seller Central is a platform for businesses to sell their products on Amazon. It gives you access to millions of customers and allows you to manage your listings, orders, and inventory in one place. With Seller Central, you have more control over your sales and can optimize your listings for better visibility and sales performance.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>The integration of Facebook Custom Audiences and Amazon Seller Central is possible through API or SDK. This means that you can sync your customer data from Amazon to Facebook, and vice versa. By doing this, you can create hyper-targeted ads to people who have already purchased from you on Amazon, or show ads to people who have visited your website but haven't yet made a purchase.</p>

	<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>

	<p>Integrating Facebook Custom Audiences and Amazon Seller Central solves several problems for your business. Firstly, it allows you to retarget customers who have previously purchased from you on Amazon and turn them into repeat customers. Secondly, it allows you to reach new customers who are likely to be interested in your products because they have similar characteristics to your existing customers. Thirdly, it allows you to track the performance of your ads and see how they are impacting your sales on both platforms.</p>
