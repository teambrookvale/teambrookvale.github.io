<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Twitter with Facebook Lead Ads: A Better Way to Generate Business Leads</h1>

	<p>Social media marketing has made it easier for businesses to reach their target audience and generate leads. Among the social media platforms, Twitter and Facebook are two of the most popular choices for businesses. Twitter has over 330 million monthly active users while Facebook has over 2 billion active users. </p>

	<p>Twitter allows businesses to connect with their audience through tweets, hashtags, and direct messages. On the other hand, Facebook Lead Ads allows businesses to capture lead information directly within the platform. When a user clicks on a Facebook Lead Ad, the lead form pops up and the user can fill out their information without ever leaving the Facebook app. </p>

	<p>However, businesses may find it time-consuming and difficult to manage and analyze social media marketing campaigns across multiple platforms. Fortunately, integrating Twitter with Facebook Lead Ads can solve these problems and provide a better way to generate business leads. </p>
