	<h1>Zapier and Salesforce Integration: How AI Makes it Better</h1>

	<p>More and more businesses are turning to automation and integration to streamline their processes and remain competitive in their industries. Two big players in this space are Zapier, an automation platform, and Salesforce, a leading customer relationship management (CRM) tool.

	<h2>AI by Zapier</h2>

	<p>Zapier is a platform that helps businesses automate repetitive tasks by connecting different apps and tools to perform tasks automatically.

Zapier also offers AI-powered tools that allow businesses to analyze and process data to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.</p>

	<h2>Salesforce</h2>

	<p>Salesforce is a CRM tool that helps businesses manage their customer interactions and data. It offers a wide range of features such as lead management, sales forecasting, customer analytics, and marketing automation.

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>

For instance, businesses can automate lead generation by creating a Zap that automatically creates a new lead in Salesforce when a user subscribes to their newsletter. Similarly, businesses can use AI-powered tools in Zapier to analyze customer data in Salesforce to gain insights and make smarter business decisions.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
