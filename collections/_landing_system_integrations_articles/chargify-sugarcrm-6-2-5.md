<div class="arttext">	<h1>Chargify and SugarCRM 6.2-5 Integration</h1>
	<p>Chargify is a subscription billing and revenue management platform while SugarCRM 6.2-5 is a customer relationship management (CRM) system. These two solutions can be integrated through API or software development kit (SDK).</p>
	<p>One of the problems that their integration solves is the seamless flow of subscription billing and customer data. With this integration, customer data collected in SugarCRM 6.2-5 can be automatically transferred to Chargify and vice versa. This eliminates the need for manual data entry and reduces data errors.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, the integration allows for easy access to customer information from both systems. For example, sales reps can access a customer's billing history from Chargify within SugarCRM and use this information to better engage with the customer.</p>
	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>The integration of Chargify and SugarCRM 6.2-5 can be achieved through API or SDK. An API is a set of protocols that enable communication between two software programs. Developers can use Chargify's API and SugarCRM's API to create custom integrations that suit their specific business needs.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, an SDK is a set of software development tools that simplify the integration process. Chargify offers a SDK for PHP, Ruby, and .NET. SugarCRM 6.2-5, on the other hand, provides a REST API that developers can use to build custom integrations.</p>
