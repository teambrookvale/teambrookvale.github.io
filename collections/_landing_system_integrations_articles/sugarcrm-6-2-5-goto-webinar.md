<div class="arttext">	<h1>SugarCRM 6.2-5 and GoTo Webinar Integration</h1>
	<p>SugarCRM is a popular customer relationship management software that helps businesses manage their customer interactions and improve overall customer experience. GoTo Webinar, on the other hand, is a popular platform for hosting webinars and online events.</p>
	<p>By integrating the two through API or SDK, businesses can streamline their lead generation and follow-up processes. When a lead registers for a webinar on GoTo Webinar, their contact information is automatically added to SugarCRM. This allows the sales team to follow up with the lead and potentially convert them into a customer. The integration also ensures that all webinar attendees are accounted for in SugarCRM, allowing for more accurate reporting and analysis.</p>
	<p>Some of the problems that the integration of SugarCRM and GoTo Webinar solves include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Manual data entry: Without integration, businesses would have to manually add webinar attendee information to SugarCRM. This can be time-consuming and prone to errors.</li>
		<li>Lack of visibility: Without integration, the sales team may not have visibility into who is attending webinars and may miss potential sales opportunities.</li>
		<li>Lack of automation: Without integration, the follow-up process would have to be manually initiated by the sales team, potentially leading to delays and missed opportunities.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of SugarCRM and GoTo Webinar through API or SDK is a valuable tool for businesses looking to streamline their lead generation and follow-up processes. By automating the data entry and follow-up process, businesses can save time and potentially convert more leads into customers. The integration also provides greater visibility into webinar attendance and helps sales teams make more informed decisions.</p>
