<div class="arttext">    <h1>SugarCRM 6.2-5 and Namely Integration</h1>
    
    <p>SugarCRM is a popular and widely used Customer Relationships Management (CRM) platform that helps companies manage their sales, marketing, and customer service operations. On the other hand, Namely is a leading HR software platform that offers HR management, payroll, time and attendance tracking, and benefits administration solutions.</p>

    <p>By integrating SugarCRM with Namely, companies can effectively manage their customer data and employee data from a single platform. This integration can be achieved through API or SDK.</p>

    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

    <p>Before this integration, companies had to manage their customer data and employee data separately, resulting in data duplication, redundant processes, and errors. By integrating SugarCRM with Namely, this problem is solved, and companies can synchronize their data accurately and efficiently.</p>

    <p>Moreover, syncing data between these two platforms eliminates the need for manual entry or transfer of data, reducing the chances of errors and saving time spent on data management tasks.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The integration of SugarCRM 6.2-5 and Namely via API or SDK is a sensible decision for companies that use both platforms. The integration offers many benefits, including improved data accuracy, better reporting, and increased efficiency. Companies can focus on their core business processes while the integration takes care of managing their employee and customer data.</p>
