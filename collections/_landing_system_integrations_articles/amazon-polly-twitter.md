	<h2>API/SDK Integration</h2>
	<p>To integrate Amazon Polly and Twitter, developers have to use API/SDK integration. The API is used to access the features of both platforms, and the SDK is used to develop applications that will help to integrate the services.</p>
	
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon Polly and Twitter solves several problems. For example, people with visual impairments will benefit from Amazon Polly's text-to-speech conversion in Tweets. Also, Twitter users can listen to their tweets, either through headphones or speakers, while engaging in other activities like driving or cooking.</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon Polly and Twitter through API/SDK presents endless possibilities to developers, businesses, and users.
