	<h2>QuickBooks Online</h2>

	<h2>PayPal</h2>
	<p>PayPal is an online payment system that allows users to send and receive payments via the internet. PayPal is widely used for online shopping and e-commerce transactions.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>QuickBooks Online and PayPal can be integrated through API or SDK. With the integration, users can automatically import transactions from PayPal into QuickBooks Online, saving time and reducing errors.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
