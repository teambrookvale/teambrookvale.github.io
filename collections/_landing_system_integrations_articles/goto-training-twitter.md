<div class="arttext">	<h1>GoTo Training and Twitter: An Integration Worth Your While</h1>
	<p>GoTo Training and Twitter, two successful tools in their respective domains, have joined hands to offer their users a unique experience. The power of these two tools is further enhanced through an API or SDK integration, popular among professionals worldwide. Here is a closer look at how this integration can solve common problems.</p>
	<h2>GoTo Training</h2>
	<p>GoTo Training is a webinar solution used for training and development of employees, clients and colleagues. With GoTo Training, you can easily schedule, coordinate and host webinars with an audience of up to 200 participants. The tool provides real-time engagement features like polling, live chats, and multimedia sharing to ensure an interactive and immersive learning experience. </p>
	<h2>Twitter</h2>
	<p>Twitter, on the other hand, is one of the most popular social media platforms, with over 330 million active users. The platform enables you to share your thoughts, ideas, and news with a global audience by composing short messages known as “tweets.” Twitter's audience ranges from average individuals to high-profile celebrities and politicians, which makes it an ideal tool for marketing and public relations.</p>
	<h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>GoTo Training's integration with Twitter's API or SDK makes for an effective platform for training and marketing. Using this integration, trainers can tweet webinars or online courses and invite followers to register. The invitation link is embedded in the tweet, which takes users directly to the GoTo training portal, where they can register for the course. </p>
	<h2>Problems Their Integration Solves</h2>
	<p>One of the significant problems that the integration of GoTo Training and Twitter solves is attracting course participants. Marketing webinars or courses through traditional means, such as emails or phone calls, may not always produce satisfactory results. However, Twitter allows you to quickly reach a large audience of interested followers and attract participants.</p>
	<p>The integration also solves scheduling problems by allowing trainers to schedule webinars through GoTo Training. Twitter, on the other hand, enables trainers to tweet reminders to their followers about upcoming webinars or courses. Participants also get notified when the course is about to start, which reduces no-shows and ensures maximum attendance.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of GoTo Training and Twitter is a strategic move that solves many problems involving training and marketing. It is easy to implement, saves time and is cost-effective. The seamless integration of the two tools guarantees maximum attendees, efficient delivery of training, and optimum business outcomes.</p>
