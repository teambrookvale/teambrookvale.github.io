<div class="arttext">    <h1>SugarCRM 6.2-5 and BigCommerce Integration</h1>
    <p>SugarCRM 6.2-5 and BigCommerce are two powerful tools that businesses use to manage their customer information and online stores respectively. However, managing them separately can be time-consuming and lead to errors. That's where integration comes in. </p>
    
    <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>The integration of SugarCRM 6.2-5 and BigCommerce is made possible through their APIs or SDKs. These allow developers to create custom applications and workflows that connect the two systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>The integration of SugarCRM 6.2-5 and BigCommerce solves several common business problems. For example, when the two systems are integrated, customer data from BigCommerce can be synced in real-time with SugarCRM. This means that the sales team always has access to the most up-to-date contact and order information, which leads to better customer service and sales.</p>
    <p>Another benefit of integration is that it eliminates the need for duplicate data entry. Instead of manually entering customer information into both systems, the integration automatically copies the data from one system to the other. This saves time and reduces the likelihood of errors.</p>
