<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Namely and Google BigQuery</h1>
	<p>Namely is a popular HR management software that companies use for their HR functions such as payroll, benefits, and performance management. On the other hand, Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse that allows users to manage and analyze large datasets efficiently. </p>
	<p>By integrating Namely and Google BigQuery through an API or SDK, organizations can get access to important HR data such as employee records, salaries, and benefits, which can be analyzed using BigQuery's powerful data processing capabilities. This integration can help solve various HR-related problems such as identifying top-performing employees, monitoring employee productivity, and predicting employee turnover rates.</p>
	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>To integrate Namely and Google BigQuery, developers can use the Namely API and the Google BigQuery SDK. The Namely API is a RESTful API that allows developers to get HR data such as employee information, payroll data, and benefits information from the Namely system. </p>
	<p>The Google BigQuery SDK, on the other hand, provides a framework for working with BigQuery datasets and tables. Developers can use the SDK to create, update, and delete datasets and tables, as well as query data using BigQuery's SQL-like syntax.</p>
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>Integrating Namely and Google BigQuery can solve various HR-related problems such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Identifying top-performing employees: By analyzing employee performance data from Namely and comparing it with other employee data such as tenure and training history, organizations can identify their top-performing employees and reward them accordingly.</li>
		<li>Monitoring employee productivity: Using data from Namely such as employee attendance records and vacation time, organizations can monitor employee productivity and identify areas where additional training or support may be necessary.</li>
		<li>Predicting employee turnover rates: By analyzing employee data such as job history, salary, and performance data, organizations can predict which employees are likely to leave and take proactive measures to prevent it, such as offering career development opportunities or increasing salary and benefits packages.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Integrating Namely and Google BigQuery through an API or SDK can provide organizations with valuable insights into their HR data, which can help them make more informed decisions about their employees. By identifying top-performing employees, monitoring employee productivity, and predicting employee turnover rates, organizations can improve employee satisfaction and retention, resulting in a more productive and successful workforce.</p>
