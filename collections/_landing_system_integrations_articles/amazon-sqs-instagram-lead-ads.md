    <h2>What are Instagram Lead Ads?</h2>
    <p>Instagram Lead Ads are ads that allow marketers to collect information from potential customers through pre-defined forms within the ads.

    <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>Integrating Amazon SQS and Instagram Lead Ads through API or SDK means that when a new lead is generated through an Instagram Lead Ad, it gets automatically sent to Amazon SQS and processed by the appropriate system or tool. This means that marketers can automate their lead collection, processing and management, substantially reducing the amount of time and effort required for manual work. </p>
    
    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

        <li>Improving lead generation workflows by streamlining and standardizing processes</li>
    </ul>
