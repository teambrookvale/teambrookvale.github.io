<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating AWS Lambda with Amazon Polly</h1>
	<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading providers of cloud computing services. AWS Lambda is one of the services provided by AWS, which is a serverless computing platform. This service allows developers to run their code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. On the other hand, Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to create lifelike speech. In this post, we will discuss how to integrate AWS Lambda with Amazon Polly.</p>

	<h2>Integration of AWS Lambda with Amazon Polly through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>Integrating AWS Lambda with Amazon Polly can be done through the API or SDK. The API provides a set of endpoints that you can use to send requests to Polly. The SDK, on the other hand, is a set of libraries that you can use to make requests to AWS services. With the SDK, you can easily make requests to Polly and have it return the speech output.</p>

	<h2>The Problems their Integration Solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda with Amazon Polly can solve several problems. For instance, it can be used to create voice-enabled applications, such as chatbots, which can interact with users in a more natural way. The integration can also be used to create audio books, podcast, and many more. Additionally, the integration can be used to create accessibility tools for people with visual impairment.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda with Amazon Polly can provide a seamless experience for developers to create lifelike speech in their applications. This integration can be beneficial in creating voice-enabled applications, audio books, podcast, among others. The adoption of this integration can also provide accessibility tools for people with visual impairment, creating a more inclusive and accessible digital world.</p>
