<div class="arttext">    <h1>BigCommerce and Amazon EC2 Integration via API/SDK</h1>
    <p>
      BigCommerce is an e-commerce platform that enables businesses to create and manage online stores. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), on the other hand, is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. These two platforms can be integrated through the use of API or SDK to leverage the strengths of each platform and create a more efficient and productive workflow.
    </p>
    
    <h2>API/SDK Integration</h2>
    <p>
      The integration of BigCommerce and Amazon EC2 can be done through the use of API or SDK. API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols that provides a way for software applications to communicate with each other. SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of development tools that allow developers to create applications for a specific platform. The use of API/SDK allows for seamless integration between the two platforms, enabling businesses to connect their online store with their cloud computing capabilities.
