	<h1>Marketo and MySQL Integration</h1>

	<p>If you're a marketer, you know the importance of collecting and analyzing data. One of the most popular marketing automation platforms today is Marketo. On the other hand, MySQL is one of the most commonly used relational database management systems. So, what happens when you integrate the two? </p>

	<h2>Integration of Marketo and MySQL</h2>

	<p>The integration of Marketo and MySQL can be done through either API (Application Programming Interface) or a SDK (Software Development Kit). API is a set of protocols and routines that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. SDK, on the other hand, is a set of tools and software development rules that enable software developers to create new applications for a specific platform.</p>

	<p>One example of a Marketo SDK is the Salesforce connector that allows you to integrate Salesforce data with Marketo. This connector directly links Marketo and Salesforce, enabling the use of Salesforce data in Marketo's lead management.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>Integrating Marketo and MySQL through API or SDK can solve a lot of problems for marketers. Firstly, it allows them to have centralized control over their data regardless of where it's stored. This means that data collected from multiple locations will be centralized in one place, which simplifies its analysis.</p>

	<p>Secondly, this integration enables an easy and fast data flow between the two systems. Marketo data can be constantly updated in MySQL, and the reverse is also possible. This means that marketers can have access to real-time data that allows them to make informed decisions.</p>

	<p>Finally, integrating Marketo and MySQL through API or SDK can automate data entry into Marketo, saving marketers time and reducing the risk of human error.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>In conclusion, integrating Marketo and MySQL through API or SDK is an excellent way for marketers to streamline their data analysis processes, save time, and reduce the risk of data errors. It offers an opportunity to have centralized control over the data collected from multiple locations, enabling real-time data that allows for informed decisions. If you're a marketer, consider integrating these two powerful systems to optimize your marketing strategies.</p>
