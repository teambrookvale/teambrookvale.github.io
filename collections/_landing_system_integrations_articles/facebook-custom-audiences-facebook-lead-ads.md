    <h2>What are Facebook Lead Ads?</h2>
    <p>Facebook Lead Ads are a form of advertising that allows businesses to collect lead information from potential customers without requiring them to leave Facebook. When someone clicks on a Lead Ad, a form opens up within the Facebook site, pre-populated with their contact information. This makes it easy for people to sign up for information or offers from businesses they are interested in.</p>

The result is a more targeted, highly effective advertising campaign that is designed to drive conversions and sales.</p>
