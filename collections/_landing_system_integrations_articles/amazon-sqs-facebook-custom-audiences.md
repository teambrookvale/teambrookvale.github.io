<div class="arttext">	<h1>Amazon SQS and Facebook Custom Audiences Integration</h1>

	<p>If you're in the world of digital marketing, you know that targeting the right audience is key. Amazon SQS and Facebook Custom Audiences are two powerful tools that can help you do just that. But did you know that integrating the two can be even more powerful? Let's take a closer look.</p>

	<h2>Amazon SQS</h2>

	<p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. </p>

	<h2>Facebook Custom Audiences</h2>

	<p>Facebook Custom Audiences is a tool that allows you to create targeted ads to specific groups of people based on the data you have on them. This includes email addresses, phone numbers, Facebook user IDs, and more. By creating a Custom Audience, you're able to show ads to people who are already familiar with your business, increasing the likelihood of conversions and reducing ad spend wastage. </p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>The integration of Amazon SQS and Facebook Custom Audiences can be achieved through their respective APIs or SDKs. By setting up a system in which Amazon SQS sends data to Facebook Custom Audiences, you're able to automate the process of creating Custom Audiences and targeting them with ads. For example, if someone buys a travel guide from your website, you can send that data to Facebook Custom Audiences and create an audience based on people who have purchased travel guides. You can then show ads for related products or services, such as travel insurance or airfare, to this audience.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>The integration of Amazon SQS and Facebook Custom Audiences solves the problem of manual data collection and audience creation. Instead of manually creating Custom Audiences based on data from your website or app, you can automate the process and create more targeted audiences for your ads. This also reduces the risk of human error and ensures that your audiences are always up-to-date.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of Amazon SQS and Facebook Custom Audiences is a powerful tool for digital marketers looking to improve their targeting and reduce ad spend wastage. By automating the process of creating Custom Audiences, you're able to focus on delivering more relevant ads to the right people, increasing the likelihood of conversions and ultimately growing your business. </p>
