	<h2>What is AWS Lambda?</h2>

	<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). With Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers.

	<p>One of the key benefits of this integration is the ability to scale your eCommerce store without having to worry about managing servers. AWS Lambda can automatically scale your application to meet demand, ensuring that your store is always running smoothly.</p>

	<p>The integration also allows you to automate tedious and time-consuming tasks, such as updating inventory levels or fulfilling orders. This can save you valuable time and resources, allowing you to focus on growing your business.</p>

	<h3>Problems Solved by Integration</h3>

	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and BigCommerce can solve a number of problems for businesses. For example, it can help to reduce the risk of errors that can occur when performing manual tasks, such as data entry or order fulfillment.</p>

	<p>It can also help to improve the overall customer experience, by ensuring that orders are fulfilled quickly and accurately, and that inventory levels are always up-to-date.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and BigCommerce is an ideal solution for businesses looking to streamline their eCommerce operations. By automating tasks and processes, you can focus on growing your business and providing a better experience for your customers.</p>
