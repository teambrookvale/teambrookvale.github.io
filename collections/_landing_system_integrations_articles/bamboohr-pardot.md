	<ul>
		<li>API integration – The API integration method allows the two systems to talk to one another, without compromising the security and confidentiality of employee data.</li>
		<li>SDK integration – The SDK integration method calls Pardot JavaScript code directly from the BambooHR user interface, enabling the user to see data from Pardot without having to visit the Pardot user interface.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>Integrating BambooHR and Pardot together allows a company to bridge the gap between HR and marketing-related processes. The integration brings a number of benefits:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Targeted marketing – With the integration, you can build targeted marketing campaigns geared towards specific positions, skills, or job titles</li>
		<li>Better efficiency – The integration eliminates the need for manual data entry into both systems, reducing the amount of time that staff spend on administrative tasks.</li>
		<li>Improved lead generation - Companies can identify top talent within their organization that helps in the lead generation and nurturing process to drive business development.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>BambooHR and Pardot have different functions within a business, but integrating the two can deliver even greater value to an organisation.
