		<h2>Salesforce</h2>
		<p>Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps businesses manage their interactions with customers. It facilitates various business processes such as sales, marketing, customer service, and collaboration to help businesses grow and increase their revenue.</p>

		<h2>Google BigQuery</h2>
		<p>Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics platform that helps businesses to analyze large-scale data. It is a serverless and highly scalable platform that allows companies to store, transform, query, and retrieve data in real-time. With BigQuery, businesses can gain valuable insights into their data and make informed decisions.</p>

		<h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>
		<p>The integration of Salesforce and Google BigQuery can be achieved through the use of an API or SDK. Salesforce provides the Salesforce Connect feature that allows businesses to connect their Salesforce data with external data sources such as Google BigQuery. The Salesforce Connect External Data Source Wizard makes it easy to set up the integration and configure the API connection parameters. On the other hand, Google BigQuery provides the BigQuery API and SDK that allow businesses to interact with their BigQuery data programmatically. By using these tools, businesses can extract data from Salesforce and load it into BigQuery for analysis.</p>

		<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>
		<p>The integration of Salesforce and Google BigQuery solves many problems faced by businesses. For example, by integrating Salesforce data with BigQuery, businesses get a comprehensive view of their customer data, enabling them to identify patterns and trends that can lead to increased sales and revenue. Additionally, the integration enables businesses to perform advanced analytics on real-time data, allowing them to make informed decisions quickly, rather than relying on gut instinct or guesswork. Finally, the integration enables businesses to streamline their data management processes by consolidating their data in one place, reducing the risk of errors and saving time when analyzing data.</p>
