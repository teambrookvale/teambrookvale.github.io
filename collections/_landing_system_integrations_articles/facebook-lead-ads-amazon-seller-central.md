    <h2>Amazon Seller Central</h2>
    <p>Amazon Seller Central is a platform for businesses selling products on Amazon. It allows businesses to manage their inventory, pricing, and orders. It also provides data and analytics to help businesses make informed decisions about their sales strategies on Amazon.</p>
    
    <h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>

The faster a business can respond to a potential customer, the more likely that customer is to become a paying customer. By automating the transfer of contact information, businesses are able to respond to potential customers more quickly.</p>
