		<p>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally.

Integration of Amazon CloudFront and Calldrip through API or SDK can provide some significant advantages for businesses.</p>
		<h2>Integration of Amazon CloudFront and Calldrip through API or SDK</h2>
		<p>Integration of Amazon CloudFront and Calldrip can be done using the Calldrip API or SDK. The Calldrip API allows businesses to access and control their Calldrip accounts programmatically.
