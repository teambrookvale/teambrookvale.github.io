<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integration of SQL Server and Zoho CRM</h1>

	<p>For businesses, keeping track of important data and customer information is crucial. This is where SQL Server and Zoho CRM come in handy. SQL Server is a relational database management system, while Zoho CRM is a customer relationship management platform.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>The two platforms can be integrated through the use of APIs (Application Programming Interface) or SDKs (Software Development Kit). APIs allow for the exchange of data between platforms, while SDKs provide a set of tools to developers to build custom integrations between the two platforms.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>The integration of SQL Server and Zoho CRM can solve several problems for businesses. One of which is data duplication. With the integration, data only needs to be entered once and it will be reflected in both platforms. This saves time and reduces the risk of errors. Additionally, the integration allows for real-time data syncing, eliminating the need for manual data transfers and updates. This ensures businesses have access to the latest and most accurate data.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of SQL Server and Zoho CRM is a powerful tool for businesses. It streamlines data management, reduces manual work, and provides accurate and up-to-date information. With the use of APIs or SDKs, businesses can build custom integrations that suit their specific needs. By utilizing these two platforms together, businesses can improve their workflow and boost productivity.</p>
