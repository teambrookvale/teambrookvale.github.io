<div class="arttext">	<h1>ServiceNow and Google BigQuery Integration - How it Solves Business Problems</h1>
	<p>ServiceNow is a leading cloud-based service management platform that enables businesses to streamline their operations and improve their customer experience. Google BigQuery, on the other hand, is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse that lets you securely analyze and process massive datasets in real-time for intelligent decision-making.</p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>Integration between ServiceNow and Google BigQuery can be done through API or SDK. The integration allows organizations to utilize the data stored in their ServiceNow instances to build custom reports, dashboards, and business Intelligence solutions in BigQuery. This enables better understanding and analysis of the data, which leads to better insights and better business decisions.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>The integration between ServiceNow and BigQuery solves several business problems. Firstly, it provides a more centralized and consistent view of your organization's data, including data from ServiceNow applications. This helps organizations make more informed decisions based on the most up-to-date data.</p>
	<p>Secondly, the integration enables the automation of data processing and analysis, which saves time and effort. Using ServiceNow workflows, data can be automatically transferred from ServiceNow to BigQuery. This allows organizations to focus more on analyzing data rather than spending time on manual data transfers.</p>
	<p>Thirdly, combining the power of both solutions provides more powerful real-time data analysis and reporting capabilities. For example, you can create reports in BigQuery, which then automatically get sent to ServiceNow on a set schedule. This enables the creation of personalized dashboards with real-time insights that are tailored for specific business units or roles in your organization.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>ServiceNow and Google BigQuery are two powerful tools for managing your organization's data. By integrating the two platforms, you can create more powerful reports, analysis, and dashboard solutions that can be used throughout your organization. This integration solves several business problems, including data consistency, automation, and real-time insights. Therefore, it is highly recommended for businesses looking to increase their data-driven capabilities and make better business decisions.</p>
