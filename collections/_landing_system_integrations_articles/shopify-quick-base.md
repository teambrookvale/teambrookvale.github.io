	<h1>Shopify and Quick Base Integration</h1>

	<p>Shopify is a popular e-commerce platform that allows businesses to create online stores, while Quick Base is a low-code application development platform used for building custom apps and automating workflows. The integration of these two platforms through API or SDK can solve many problems for businesses.</p>

	<h2>API or SDK Integration</h2>

	<p>The integration of Shopify and Quick Base is done through API or SDK. API (Application Programming Interface) is a software interface that allows different systems to communicate with each other, while SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of tools that allow developers to create applications for specific platforms.</p>

	<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>

	<p>The integration of Shopify and Quick Base can solve many problems for businesses. One of the problems is the need for manual data entry.
