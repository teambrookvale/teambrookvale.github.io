	<h1>Integrating BigCommerce and WHMCS: Solving Problems through API or SDK</h1>

	<p>BigCommerce and WHMCS are two powerful e-commerce platforms that serve different but complementary purposes: BigCommerce is designed for selling products online, while WHMCS is a billing and automation platform for web hosting and related services. However, if you run an e-commerce website that also offers web hosting services, you may want to integrate these two platforms to streamline your business operations and improve your customers' experience. This can be achieved through API or SDK, which allows the two platforms to communicate with each other and exchange data seamlessly.</p>
