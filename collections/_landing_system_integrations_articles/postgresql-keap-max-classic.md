The API allows businesses to send and receive data between the two systems using standard HTTP requests, while the SDK offers a more streamlined approach for developers to integrate PostgreSQL into their Keap Max Classic projects.</p>
    <p>Through these integrations, businesses can realize many benefits, including the ability to:</p>

      <li>Enable faster, more informed decision-making across the organization</li>
    </ul>
