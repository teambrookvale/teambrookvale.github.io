<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integration of Namely and MySQL</h1>
	<p>Namely is a cloud-based HR software that provides human resource management solutions for businesses. MySQL, on the other hand, is an open-source relational database management system.</p>
	<p>The integration of the two technologies can be achieved through API or SDK. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, tools, and routines for building software applications. It enables different software components to communicate with each other. Namely has an API that allows other software applications to access its HR services. MySQL, on the other hand, has an SDK (Software Development Kit) that provides a set of libraries and tools for software developers to build applications that interact with the MySQL database.</p>
	<p>By integrating Namely and MySQL, businesses can benefit from the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Seamless synchronization of employee information between Namely and MySQL.</li>
		<li>Better management of employee data and records, including payroll, performance reviews, and benefits.</li>
		<li>Improved accuracy and timeliness of data processing.</li>
		<li>Centralized data storage and retrieval, which makes it easier to manage and access employee records.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Moreover, the integration of Namely and MySQL can also enable businesses to develop custom HR software applications that work seamlessly with their HR and database management needs.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Namely and MySQL is a potent combination that can help businesses manage their HR needs more efficiently and accurately. The use of API or SDK makes it possible to connect these two technologies, allowing for seamless data synchronization, better management of employee information, and improved accuracy and timeliness of data processing.</p>
