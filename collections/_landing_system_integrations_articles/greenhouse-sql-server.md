<div class="arttext">	<h1>Greenhouse and SQL Server Integration</h1>

	<p>Greenhouse is a popular applicant tracking system (ATS) used by businesses to streamline their recruitment process. On the other hand, SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store, manage and retrieve data in various formats.</p>

	<p>The integration of Greenhouse and SQL Server through API or SDK allows businesses to easily transfer applicant data from Greenhouse to their SQL Server databases without the need for manual data entry or file uploads. This creates an automated and efficient process, allowing companies to focus on other important tasks.</p>

	<p>One of the major problems that this integration solves is the need for duplicate data entry. By using APIs or SDKs, businesses can ensure that all data entered into Greenhouse is automatically transferred to their SQL Server databases, eliminating the risk of errors caused by manual data entry.</p>

	<p>This integration also solves the problem of limited data access. By storing data in SQL Server databases, businesses can easily access their applicant data from anywhere, at any time, using any device. This allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in managing and analyzing applicant data.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of Greenhouse and SQL Server through APIs or SDKs is a great way for businesses to streamline their recruitment process, eliminate manual data entry, and improve data access. By automating this process, businesses can save time and resources, and focus on more important tasks related to recruitment and hiring.</p>
