	<p>Amazon CloudWatch is a web service that provides monitoring for AWS resources and applications, whereas Amazon Seller Central is an online platform that allows sellers to manage their inventory, fulfill orders, and handle customer inquiries on Amazon.</p>
	<p>Integrating the two through API or SDK can provide a seamless experience for sellers on the Amazon marketplace. This integration allows sellers to configure thresholds for important metrics, such as inventory levels and order fulfilment times, and receive automated alerts through CloudWatch when these thresholds are breached. This makes it easier for sellers to manage their businesses and ensures that they are always aware of important changes in their operations.</p>
