	<p>Google Groups, on the other hand, is a free service that enables users to create and manage email groups for discussion, collaboration, and communication. It allows users to share documents, send messages, announcements, and updates to a specific group of people.</p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>Integrating Zendesk and Google Groups through API or SDK allows support teams to efficiently manage support tickets and communicate with customers. Zendesk can be used to receive and manage support tickets, while Google Groups can be used to communicate with customers and provide updates on their requests and inquiries.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

Firstly, it optimizes communication and collaboration between support teams, which can improve the speed and quality of responses.

Lastly, it can reduce response times, which can lead to better customer satisfaction levels.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
