			<h2>Introduction to Amazon SQS</h2>
			<p>
				Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a message queuing service that enables decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. The service provides a reliable, highly scalable, and fully managed messaging system that allows you to send, store, and receive messages between software components.</p>

			<h2>Introduction to Amazon Polly</h2>
			<p>
				Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service that converts written text into realistic speech, allowing users to create audio files, and make informative audio recordings. The technology uses cutting-edge deep learning technologies to create high-quality intelligent speech synthesis functionalities. Amazon Polly empowers developers to create applications that provide real-time language translation, natural language conversations, and accessibility solutions for individuals with hearing or vision deficiencies.</p>

			<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
			<p>
				The integration between Amazon SQS and Amazon Polly can be achieved through the use of API or SDKs. Developers can configure the Amazon SQS queue to receive the text and metadata of the audio files they want to generate. Once the message arrives in the queue, the consumer can immediately retrieve it and send it to Amazon Polly. Amazon Polly converts the text into audio files, which can then be returned to the SQS queue for access by other members of the production workflow.</p>

			<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
			<p>
				Before the integration between Amazon Polly and Amazon SQS, audio transcription required significant resources and time-consuming manual effort. Organizations would need to hire transcriptionists to manually transcribe audio files. But with this integration, audio processing is easier than ever before. Developers can create automated workflows that convert text into high-quality speech, removing the manual labor needed to generate audio files.</p>
			<p>
				Amazon SQS and Amazon Polly integration provides solutions to other complex problems, such as real-time translation of text into speech. Developers can create multilingual audio files, providing broad accessibility to speech solutions.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				The integration between Amazon SQS and Amazon Polly is a game-changer in audio processing solutions. Now, organizations can create scalable, low-cost, and high-quality production workflows that automate the generation of audio files. Companies can create audio files in multilingual formats and accessibly produce high-quality audio content without manual intensive labor. By integrating Amazon SQS and Amazon Polly, developers can create solutions that are reliable, highly scalable, and easy to maintain, providing a wide range of benefits to organizations. </p>
