	<main>
		<h2>Amazon Seller Central</h2>
		<p>Amazon Seller Central is an online platform developed and maintained by Amazon that allows businesses to sell their products directly to customers on Amazon's website. With Seller Central, businesses can manage their inventory, pricing, and orders in one place.</p>
		<h2>BigCommerce</h2>
		<p>BigCommerce is a powerful eCommerce platform that enables businesses to build and maintain their own online store. With BigCommerce, businesses can customize their online store, manage their orders and inventory, and offer various payment and shipping options.</p>
		<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
		<p>The integration of Amazon Seller Central and BigCommerce allows businesses to sell on both platforms simultaneously. Integrating the two platforms can be achieved through the use of their respective APIs or SDKs (software development kits). The API or SDK allows the two platforms to communicate with each other, exchanging information such as inventory levels, pricing, and order details.</p>
		<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Streamlined inventory management:</strong> By integrating the two platforms, businesses can easily manage their inventory levels on both Amazon and their BigCommerce store. This means that businesses can avoid selling out-of-stock items on either platform and ensure that their customers have a positive shopping experience.</li>
			<li><strong>Increased sales:</strong> By selling on both platforms, businesses can reach a wider audience and potentially increase their sales.</li>
			<li><strong>Centralized order management:</strong> With the integration, businesses can manage their orders in one location, making it easier to fulfill orders and provide customers with updates on their purchases.</li>
			<li><strong>Automation:</strong> The integration can automate various processes such as updating inventory levels, product listings, and order details, saving businesses time and reducing the risk of errors.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>The integration of Amazon Seller Central and BigCommerce can offer many benefits to businesses, including streamlined inventory management, increased sales, centralized order management, and automation of processes. By using the respective APIs or SDKs, businesses can easily integrate the two platforms and enjoy the benefits of selling on both Amazon and their own online store through BigCommerce.</p>
