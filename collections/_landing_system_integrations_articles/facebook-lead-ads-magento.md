	<h2>What are Facebook Lead Ads?</h2>
	<p>Facebook Lead Ads are a type of Facebook ad that allows businesses to capture leads directly on Facebook, without requiring the user to leave the platform.

	<h2>Integration of Facebook Lead Ads and Magento through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>By integrating Facebook Lead Ads with Magento, businesses can streamline their lead capture process and save time on manual data entry. Using either the Facebook API or SDK, businesses can automatically transfer the lead information collected through Facebook Lead Ads directly into their Magento database. This allows businesses to quickly follow up with potential customers and convert leads into sales. </p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
