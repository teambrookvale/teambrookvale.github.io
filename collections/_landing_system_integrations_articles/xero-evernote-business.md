		<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
		<p>In order for the two solutions to be integrated, they use an Application Programming Interface (API) or Software Development Kit (SDK), which allows two separate software applications to communicate with each other.</p>
		<p>Through the API or SDK, Xero users can automatically transfer data from Evernote Business to Xero. By doing so, it reduces the time-consuming task of manually transferring data between the two applications. This helps businesses become more efficient as they now have a centralized platform to manage their accounting and project management tasks.</p>
