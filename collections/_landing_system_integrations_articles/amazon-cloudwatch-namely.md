	<p>Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service for applications hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Namely, on the other hand, is a human resources management platform. These two services can be integrated through API or SDK to provide a powerful solution for monitoring and managing employee resources.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>Integrating Amazon CloudWatch and Namely through API or SDK allows the two services to communicate with each other seamlessly. This integration ensures that Namely receives real-time monitoring data from Amazon CloudWatch and can take appropriate action based on that information.</p>

	<p>Through this integration, Amazon CloudWatch offers a range of monitoring capabilities such as resource usage, application performance, log monitoring, and serverless architecture. On the other hand, Namely provides a comprehensive suite of HR solutions such as employee management, payroll management, and compliance management.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>Integrating Amazon CloudWatch and Namely solves workflow inefficiencies for HR and IT teams.
