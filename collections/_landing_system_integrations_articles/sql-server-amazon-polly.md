<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integration of SQL Server and Amazon Polly</h1>
	<p>SQL Server and Amazon Polly are two powerful tools that are widely used in the tech industry. SQL Server is a relational database management system while Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service that converts text into lifelike speech.</p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>The integration of SQL Server and Amazon Polly is possible through their respective APIs or SDKs.</p>
	<p>Amazon Pollyâ€™s API provides an easy-to-use interface for developers to use text-to-speech capabilities in their applications. Similarly, SQL Server's SDK enables developers to integrate it with their applications and perform various database operations.</p>
	<p>Using these APIs and SDKs respectively, developers can create custom applications that can interact with both services and extract the required data.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of SQL Server and Amazon Polly solves several problems in the tech industry. One of the most significant problems that this integration solves is that it helps visually impaired people. The SQL Server database can store information, and Amazon Polly can convert it into audio format. This method is beneficial for visually impaired people who can then listen to the content.</p>
	<p>Companies can also use this integration to provide customers with speech-enabled self-service applications. These applications can answer frequently asked questions, and also have voice navigation capabilities.</p>
	<p>Another benefit of this integration is that it allows companies to analyze data collected through Amazon Polly. Through the SQL Server database, companies can build reports and analyze speech patterns to derive useful insights.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of SQL Server and Amazon Polly provides limitless possibilities and benefits to businesses and individuals. The ability to store, analyze and retrieve data through SQL Server, and then convert it into speech format using Amazon Polly, enables developers and companies to create innovative and accessible applications that can help millions of people worldwide.</p>
