<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Google BigQuery and Greenhouse</h1>

	<p>Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse that allows users to process massive amounts of data in seconds. Greenhouse, on the other hand, is a popular applicant tracking system (ATS) that helps businesses manage their recruitment process. While both these platforms serve unique purposes, there may be instances where they need to be integrated to solve specific problems.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>Integrating Google BigQuery and Greenhouse can be done through its application programming interface (API) or software development kit (SDK). By using the API or SDK, businesses can automatically transfer data from Greenhouse to Google BigQuery, allowing easier access and analysis of recruitment data.</p>

	<h2>Solving Integration Problems</h2>

	<p>One of the main problems that the integration of Google BigQuery and Greenhouse can solve is the ability to create custom reports. With Greenhouse data stored in BigQuery, companies can easily generate reports that are specific to their recruitment processes. This provides valuable insights and helps companies make data-driven recruitment decisions.</p>

	<p>Additionally, the integration of Google BigQuery and Greenhouse helps businesses analyze their recruitment processes on a deeper level. By combining data from other sources such as social media or job boards, companies can gain a better understanding of their recruitment funnel and make informed hiring decisions.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Integrating Google BigQuery and Greenhouse can provide numerous benefits to businesses, especially those with large recruitment processes. By leveraging the power of BigQuery to analyze data from Greenhouse, companies can streamline their recruitment processes and make data-driven decisions. With the help of its API or SDK, integrating Google BigQuery and Greenhouse is a seamless process that can transform the way businesses manage their recruitment processes.</p>
