<div class="arttext">	<h1>Expensify and Namely Integration</h1>

	<p>Expensify and Namely are two popular software platforms that help businesses streamline their processes. Expensify is a platform that simplifies expense reporting and management, while Namely is an HR platform that helps manage employee data and payroll.</p>

	<p>Integration of the two platforms through API or SDK can provide many benefits to businesses.</p>

	<h2>Integration of Expensify and Namely through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>The integration of Expensify and Namely allows for seamless transfer of data between the two platforms. An API (Application Programming Interface) or SDK (Software Development Kit) can be used to create a bridge between the two platforms.</p>

	<p>With the integration, data such as employee information, expenses, and reimbursements can be shared between the two platforms without the need for manual data entry. For example, when an employee submits an expense report on Expensify, the data is automatically synced with Namely, eliminating the need for manual entry of data into both platforms.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>The integration of Expensify and Namely can solve many problems for businesses. One key problem it solves is the need for manual entry of data, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. By automating the transfer of data between the platforms, businesses can save time and reduce the risk of errors.</p>

	<p>Another problem it solves is the lack of integration between different software platforms. Many businesses use multiple software platforms to manage different aspects of their operations, and the lack of integration can result in data silos. By integrating Expensify and Namely, businesses can break down these silos and create a unified system for managing their data.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of Expensify and Namely through API or SDK can provide many benefits to businesses. By automating the transfer of data between the two platforms, businesses can save time, reduce the risk of errors, and create a unified system for managing their data. If your business uses Expensify and Namely, consider exploring the option of integrating the two platforms to streamline your processes.</p>
