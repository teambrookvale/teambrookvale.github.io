<div class="arttext">    <h1>Integrating AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudFront</h1>
    <p>
      The integration of AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudFront allows developers to
      create scalable and reliable serverless applications with low latency and
      high availability. Lambda allows you to run your code without having to
      manage any servers, while CloudFront provides a global content delivery
      network that delivers your content to end users with low latency and high
      transfer speeds.
    </p>
    <h2>AWS Lambda</h2>
    <p>
      AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run your
      code without having to manage any servers. You only pay for the compute time
      that you consume, and Lambda scales automatically to handle thousands of
      requests per second. Lambda supports many programming languages including
      Node.js, Python, Java, and C#.
    </p>
    <h2>Amazon CloudFront</h2>
    <p>
      Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that serves your
      content from a global network of edge locations. CloudFront delivers your
      content with low latency and high transfer speeds by detecting the location
      of the end user and dynamically routing requests to the nearest available
      edge location. CloudFront also provides security features like SSL/TLS
      encryption and access control.
    </p>
    <h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>
      You can integrate AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudFront using the
      CloudFront-triggered Lambda edge function. The CloudFront-triggered Lambda
      edge function allows you to execute custom logic on incoming requests to
      CloudFront edge locations. You can write your own Lambda code to modify the
      request or response headers, generate dynamic content, or authenticate
      users.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use the AWS SDKs to interact with both AWS Lambda and Amazon
      CloudFront programmatically. The SDKs are available in many programming
      languages and allow you to easily create, deploy, and manage Lambda
      functions and CloudFront distributions.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>
      The integration of AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudFront can solve several
      problems for developers. First, it allows you to create serverless
      applications that can handle high traffic and provide low latency to end
      users. Second, it provides a scalable and reliable way to run your code
      without having to manage any servers. Third, it allows you to easily
      modify incoming requests and responses to CloudFront edge locations with
      custom logic.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The integration of AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudFront provides a powerful
      way to create scalable and reliable serverless applications with low
      latency and high availability. The CloudFront-triggered Lambda edge
      function and the AWS SDKs provide developers with the tools they need to
      easily create, deploy, and manage Lambda functions and CloudFront
      distributions. By leveraging these technologies, developers can focus on
      writing code instead of managing servers, and deliver fast and reliable
      content to end users around the globe.
