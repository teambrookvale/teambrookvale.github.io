<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integration of Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Lambda</h1>

	<p>Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It helps to monitor the resources and applications on AWS, which improves the overall reliability and performance of the systems. On the other hand, AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that enables developers to run their code without provisioning or managing servers. It enables the execution of code in response to events such as changes to objects in S3 buckets, updates to DynamoDB tables, or API calls to AWS services.</p>

	<p>Integrating Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Lambda via API or SDK is a useful way for developers to monitor and troubleshoot Lambda functions. CloudWatch can be used to collect and track the metrics, logs, and events generated by Lambda functions. The integration enables the developers to easily monitor the performance and health of any Lambda function and to take appropriate action when there are issues. </p>

	<p>The integration also enables the developers to set up alarms in CloudWatch to notify them of any issues. For example, if the Lambda function takes longer than expected to complete, the CloudWatch alarm can trigger an SNS notification to the developers, allowing them to address the issue quickly.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>Integrating Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Lambda helps to solve various problems such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Monitoring and troubleshooting Lambda functions</li>
		<li>Tracking and analyzing the performance of Lambda functions</li>
		<li>Setting up and receiving alerts when there are issues with Lambda functions</li>
		<li>Optimizing the cost and efficiency of Lambda functions</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Integrating Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Lambda via API or SDK is a useful way for developers to monitor and troubleshoot Lambda functions. This integration helps developers to easily monitor the performance and health of different Lambda functions, set up alarms to notify them of any issues, and optimize the cost and efficiency of Lambda functions. This integration is a must-have for any developers who rely on AWS Lambda to run their applications</p>
