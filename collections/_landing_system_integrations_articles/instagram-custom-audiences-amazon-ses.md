<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Instagram Custom Audiences with Amazon SES</h1>

	<p>As businesses aim to reach a larger audience, they are utilizing various marketing strategies, two of which are Instagram Custom Audiences and Amazon SES. Instagram Custom Audiences allows businesses to create a custom audience based on specific criteria and target them with ads. Amazon SES, on the other hand, is an email marketing service that enables businesses to send emails to their customers and subscribers.</p>

	<p>Integrating the two services is beneficial as it allows businesses to create and send targeted emails to their Instagram Custom Audiences, leading to a higher engagement rate and ROI. This integration can be achieved through an API or SDK. </p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>Prior to integration, businesses faced numerous challenges in marketing their products and services. One of the main challenges was sending email campaigns to their Instagram Custom Audiences. This was because businesses could only create an audience on Instagram but could not send email campaigns to them. The integration of the two services now solves this problem by allowing businesses to take advantage of their Instagram Custom Audiences and send targeted emails to them via Amazon SES.</p>

	<p>Another challenge businesses faced was reaching a large and relevant audience. Instagram Custom Audiencesâ€™ custom targeting enables businesses to target audiences based on specific criteria, while Amazon SES allows businesses to send high volumes of emails to their subscribers. Combining these two services helps businesses reach a larger and more relevant audience, which in turn leads to higher engagement rates and more sales.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Integrating Instagram Custom Audiences and Amazon SES is a great marketing strategy that businesses can use to reach a larger and more targeted audience. This integration solves the problem of sending email campaigns to Instagram Custom Audiences and helps businesses reach a larger audience, leading to better engagement rates and more sales. By utilizing this integration, businesses can take their marketing efforts to the next level and stay ahead of the competition.</p>
