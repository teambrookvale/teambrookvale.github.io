		<h2>What is SQL Server</h2>
		<p>SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft Corporation. It is used to manage, organize and access data in an efficient and secure manner. With SQL Server, organizations can store, retrieve and manipulate data effectively, enabling better decision making and business operations.</p>

		<h2>What is AWS Lambda</h2>
		<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows developers to write and run code without needing to provision or manage servers. The service automatically scales based on the number of requests, making it a cost-effective and efficient solution for various applications and use cases.</p>

		<h2>Integration of SQL Server and AWS Lambda</h2>
		<p>API and SDK enable seamless communication between SQL Server and AWS Lambda, allowing organizations to integrate their data and computing services across their systems. The integration enables the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Real-time data processing: AWS Lambda triggers SQL Server whenever new data is received, allowing organizations to process data in real-time and make immediate decisions based on the information.</li>
			<li>Reduced load on SQL Server: By using AWS Lambda to execute some computing tasks, organizations can reduce the load on their SQL Server database, resulting in faster processing and better performance.</li>
			<li>Cost-effective solution: The integration of SQL Server and AWS Lambda can reduce the costs of hardware and maintenance while providing flexible and scalable computing power.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Problems the Integration Solves</h2>
		<p>The integration of SQL Server and AWS Lambda solves several problems, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Inefficient and slow data processing: The integration enables real-time processing of data, allowing organizations to make quick and accurate decisions based on the information.</li>
			<li>High cost of hardware and maintenance: The integration provides a cost-effective solution that reduces hardware costs while enabling the organization to scale its computing power effectively.</li>
			<li>Overloaded SQL Server: By using AWS Lambda to execute computing tasks, the integration reduces the load on SQL Server, resulting in faster processing and better performance.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>The integration of SQL Server and AWS Lambda provides a powerful and cost-effective solution for managing data and computing services. With API and SDK, organizations can integrate their systems seamlessly and enjoy the benefits of real-time processing, reduced hardware costs, and increased performance. By adopting this integration, organizations can stay ahead of the competition and achieve their business objectives more efficiently.</p>
