<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Amazon Polly and EC2</h1>
	<p>Amazon Polly is a cloud-based text-to-speech service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses advanced deep learning to understand the nuances of human speech and generate lifelike speech. Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to have complete control of their computing resources and to scale their capacity up or down as needed.</p>
	<p>By integrating Amazon Polly and EC2, users can leverage the text-to-speech capabilities of Polly in their EC2 applications. This can be done through the use of APIs or SDKs.</p>
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon Polly and EC2 can help solve several problems for users. Firstly, it can help to improve accessibility for visually impaired users. By converting text to speech and delivering it through EC2, users can listen to the content of websites or applications instead of relying on visual inputs.</p>
	<p>Secondly, the integration can be used to enhance the customer experience. By providing lifelike speech instead of machine-generated audio, applications can provide a more personalized and engaging experience for customers.</p>
	<p>Lastly, the integration can help with cost optimization. By leveraging the scalable compute resources of EC2, users can reduce the cost of their text-to-speech operations and only pay for the resources they use.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon Polly and EC2 can provide numerous benefits for users, including improved accessibility, enhanced customer experience, and cost optimization. With the use of APIs and SDKs, integrating the two services can be done quickly and easily. We highly recommend exploring the benefits of this integration for your applications and websites.</p>
