<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating ServiceNow and Google Groups</h1>

	<p>ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform for managing IT services and operations, while Google Groups is a tool for creating and managing mailing lists and discussion groups. </p>

	<p>The integration of these two platforms can be done through API or SDK, allowing users to access ServiceNow data directly from Google Groups or vice versa. </p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>Combining the functionalities of ServiceNow and Google Groups cater to a need where IT depart-ments must communicate and collaborate with different teams. Users can be added or removed from a mailing list based on their IT service requirements. ServiceNow incidents can be assigned to a group through an email trigger and change requests can get immediate clearance once approved by the correct authorities in the group. </p>

	<p>Moreover, the integration of ServiceNow and Google Groups can automate and streamline a number of processes, saving significant time and resources. </p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Integrating ServiceNow and Google Groups is a practical solution that addresses a number of issues that IT departments face when managing service requests and incidents. Through this integration, users can communicate and collaborate more efficiently, while also providing greater transparency and efficiency.</p>
