<div class="arttext">	<h1>AWS Lambda and Google BigQuery Integration</h1>

	<p>Both AWS Lambda and Google BigQuery are powerful tools on their own, but when integrated, they can provide even greater benefits for businesses and organizations.</p>

	<h2>What is AWS Lambda?</h2>
	<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by AWS. It allows developers to run code without having to manage any servers or infrastructure. Instead, AWS Lambda runs the code in response to certain events or triggers. This means that developers can focus on writing code rather than worrying about servers or infrastructure. </p>

	<h2>What is Google BigQuery?</h2>
	<p>Google BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse service that enables super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. It offers real-time analysis, data visualization, and machine learning capabilities. </p>

	<h2>Integration of AWS Lambda and Google BigQuery</h2>
	<p>One way to integrate AWS Lambda and Google BigQuery is through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or SDKs (Software Development Kits). AWS provides a Java SDK for accessing Google BigQuery, and Google provides a REST API for accessing BigQuery. Using these tools, developers can write code in AWS Lambda that accesses data in BigQuery, or perform data processing using AWS Lambda, and then send the results to BigQuery.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and Google BigQuery can solve a number of problems, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reducing costs: AWS Lambda's serverless architecture means that developers don't have to worry about managing servers or infrastructure. Additionally, Google BigQuery's pay-as-you-go pricing model means that users are only charged for the amount of data processed.</li>
		<li>Improving scalability: AWS Lambda and Google BigQuery are both highly scalable services, meaning that as demand grows, the services can easily handle the increased workload.</li>
		<li>Enabling real-time data processing: AWS Lambda can be used to process data in real-time, and the results can be sent to Google BigQuery for further analysis.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and Google BigQuery can provide businesses and organizations with a powerful tool for data processing and analysis. By combining AWS Lambda's serverless computing with Google BigQuery's powerful data warehousing capabilities, developers can create a scalable, cost-effective, and real-time data processing solution.</p>
