<div class="arttext">	<h1>WHMCS and Greenhouse Integration</h1>
	<p>WHMCS is a popular web hosting automation platform, while Greenhouse is a cloud-based recruiting software. Both platforms serve different purposes, but when integrated, they can complement each other's functionalities. This article discusses the benefits of integrating WHMCS and Greenhouse, as well as the technical aspects of such integration.</p>
	
	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>The integration of WHMCS and Greenhouse can be achieved through their respective APIs or SDKs. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules for communication between software applications, while an SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of programming tools that developers can use to create software applications. Both WHMCS and Greenhouse provide APIs and SDKs that allow developers to connect the two platforms and create automated workflows.</p>
	
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of WHMCS and Greenhouse solves several problems faced by web hosting companies, such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Manual data entry: without integration, web hosting companies would have to manually enter candidate information from Greenhouse into WHMCS, increasing the risk of errors and duplication.</li>
		<li>Inefficient processes: integrating the two platforms allows for seamless data transfer, which results in faster and more efficient recruitment processes.</li>
		<li>Lack of visibility: integration allows users to have a single view of candidate data across both platforms, improving the overall recruitment experience.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Integrating WHMCS and Greenhouse through API or SDK results in an improved recruitment process for web hosting companies. The integration solves various issues faced in the recruitment process, such as manual data entry, inefficient processes and lack of visibility, and provides a more seamless and efficient workflow.</p>
