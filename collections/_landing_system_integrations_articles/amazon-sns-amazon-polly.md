Amazon Polly, on the other hand, is a service that turns text into lifelike speech using advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech.</p>
	<p>It is possible to integrate Amazon SNS and Amazon Polly using the API or SDK. With this integration, you can easily send voice notifications to various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, tablets, and PCs. Developers can also use this integration to enable speech in their applications, increasing accessibility for users with hearing disabilities.</p>
	<p>The integration of Amazon SNS and Amazon Polly solves several problems in the communication space. Firstly, it enables businesses and organizations to send voice notifications to their users in an accessible and human-like manner. This makes the notifications more engaging and informative, increasing the likelihood that the user will take actions based on the notification.</p>
	<p>Secondly, this integration helps developers to create more inclusive applications that cater to users with hearing disabilities. By enabling speech in their application, they can make it more accessible to users who cannot hear or struggle with reading text.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
