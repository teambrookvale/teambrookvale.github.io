    <h1>Integration of SQL Server and Facebook Lead Ads through API or SDK</h1> 

    <p>SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft Corporation. It is widely used in enterprise-level applications for storing, managing, and retrieving large amounts of data. Facebook Lead Ads, on the other hand, is a tool developed by Facebook for generating leads and collecting data from potential customers. </p>

    <p>Through the integration of SQL Server and Facebook Lead Ads, businesses can efficiently manage the data collected through Lead Ads.</p>

    <h2>API or SDK Integration</h2> 

    <p>The integration of SQL Server and Facebook Lead Ads can be achieved through the use of API (Application Programming Interface) or SDK (Software Development Kit). </p>

    <p>The API integration allows developers to create custom applications that can interact with both SQL Server and Facebook Lead Ads. On the other hand, the SDK integration provides a set of tools that enable developers to create applications that can communicate with Facebook Lead Ads and SQL Server more easily.</p>

    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2> 

    <p>Before the integration of SQL Server and Facebook Lead Ads, businesses used to face a lot of challenges in managing and interpreting the data collected through Lead Ads. Some of the major problems were: </p>

    <ol> 

      <li>Data redundancy: As the data collected through Lead Ads was stored separately, it often led to data duplication and inconsistency.</li> 

      <li>Data security: Managing data in multiple systems made it difficult to ensure the security and integrity of data.</li> 

      <li>Data tracking: It was difficult to track and analyze the performance of Lead Ads in real-time.</li> 

    </ol> 

    <p>However, through the integration of SQL Server and Facebook Lead Ads, businesses can efficiently manage the data, ensure its security, and track its performance more easily.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2> 

    <p>The integration of SQL Server and Facebook Lead Ads through API or SDK has made it easier for businesses to manage and analyze the data collected through Lead Ads. With this integration, businesses can ensure data integrity, security, and improve their lead generation and customer acquisition strategies.</p>
