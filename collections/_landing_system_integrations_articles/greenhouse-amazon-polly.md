    <p>
      Greenhouse is a recruitment platform that helps companies and organizations manage their hiring processes. It provides tools for attracting, engaging, and hiring top talent. One of the key features of Greenhouse is its ability to automate aspects of the recruitment process, such as scheduling interviews, sending reminder emails, and collecting feedback from interviewers.

      Amazon Polly, on the other hand, is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. With it, companies can create voiceovers for videos, generate audio versions of digital content, and develop chatbots and voice-enabled applications. Amazon Polly supports multiple languages and voices, and provides a variety of customization options.

      The integration of Greenhouse and Amazon Polly is made possible through the use of APIs or SDKs (software development kits). APIs allow different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other, while SDKs provide pre-built code libraries for developers to use when creating software applications.

      By integrating Greenhouse and Amazon Polly, recruiters can automate the process of sending reminder emails to candidates. Rather than having to manually type out each email, recruiters can use Amazon Polly to create a voiceover of the email and send it to candidates through Greenhouse. This not only saves time but also makes the candidate experience more personal and engaging.
