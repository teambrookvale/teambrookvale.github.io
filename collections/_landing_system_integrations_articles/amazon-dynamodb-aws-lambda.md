  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Amazon DynamoDB</h2>
    <p>Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to deliver high performance and scalability for web applications that require low latency and seamless scalability. DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that allows developers to store and retrieve data in a highly available, fault-tolerant, and secure way.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>AWS Lambda</h2>
    <p>AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, developers are billed only for the compute time consumed by their code, making it a cost-effective solution for running event-driven, stateless, and short-running functions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>Amazon DynamoDB and AWS Lambda can be integrated through the API or SDK provided by AWS. The integration allows developers to trigger Lambda functions when data is added, modified, or deleted in DynamoDB. This enables developers to build real-time and event-driven applications that respond to changes in DynamoDB data without setting up their own infrastructure or managing complex integrations.</p> 
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>The integration of Amazon DynamoDB and AWS Lambda solves several problems for developers, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reducing infrastructure complexity and cost by eliminating the need for servers and managing them</li>
      <li>Enabling real-time and event-driven applications that respond to changes in data without polling or long-polling</li>
      <li>Enhancing scalability and performance by leveraging the capabilities of DynamoDB and Lambda</li>
      <li>Improving security, reliability, and availability by using managed services provided by AWS</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The integration of Amazon DynamoDB and AWS Lambda is a powerful solution for building scalable and event-driven applications that respond to changes in data. By leveraging the capabilities of DynamoDB and Lambda, developers can reduce infrastructure complexity, improve scalability and performance, and enhance security, reliability, and availability. As AWS continues to innovate and improve its services, we can expect to see more powerful integrations like this in the future.</p>
