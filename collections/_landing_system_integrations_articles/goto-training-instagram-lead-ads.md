	<h2>About Instagram Lead Ads</h2>
	<p>Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. With over 1 billion monthly users, it is a valuable tool for businesses to reach and connect with potential customers. Instagram Lead Ads are a form of advertising that allow businesses to collect contact information from users who are interested in their products or services.</p>
	<h2>Integration via API or SDK</h2>
	<p>The integration of GoTo Training and Instagram Lead Ads is made possible through the use of an API or SDK. By connecting the two platforms, businesses can create ads that link directly to their GoTo Training events or courses. Users who click on the ad will be taken to a landing page where they can register for the event. This integration saves time and effort by eliminating the need for separate registration pages or manual data entry.</p>
	<h2>Problems the Integration Solves</h2>
