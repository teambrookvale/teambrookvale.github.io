<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integration of Google Ads and Salesforce</h1>
	
	<p>Both Google Ads and Salesforce are powerful tools for businesses. Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords, is an advertising platform that allows businesses to create and display ads on various Google platforms. Salesforce, on the other hand, is a customer relationship management (CRM) system that helps businesses manage customer data, sales, and marketing.</p>
	
	<p>By integrating Google Ads and Salesforce, businesses can improve their advertising and customer management strategies. This integration can be achieved through an API (application programming interface) or SDK (software development kit).</p>
	
	<h2>Problems their integration solved</h2>
	<p>The integration of Google Ads and Salesforce solves several problems for businesses. Firstly, it allows businesses to track conversions and leads from their Google Ads campaigns directly within Salesforce. This makes it easier for businesses to analyze the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and make informed decisions about their marketing strategies.</p>
	
	<p>Additionally, businesses can use the integration to create more targeted advertising campaigns. They can use data from Salesforce to create custom audiences for their Google Ads campaigns, ensuring that their ads are shown to the right people at the right time. This can lead to higher click-through rates, conversions, and ROI (return on investment).</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>In conclusion, integrating Google Ads and Salesforce can provide businesses with a range of benefits. From improved advertising analytics to more targeted campaigns, this integration can help businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and grow their businesses. As such, it is worth considering for any business that wants to improve its advertising and customer management efforts.</p>
