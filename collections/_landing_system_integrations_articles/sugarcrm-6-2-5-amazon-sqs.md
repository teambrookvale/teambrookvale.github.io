<div class="arttext">	<h1>SugarCRM 6.2-5 and Amazon SQS Integration</h1>
	<p>SugarCRM is a leading CRM software that helps businesses manage their customer data and interactions effectively. On the other hand, Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a message queuing service that enables decoupling of distributed systems.</p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>Integrating SugarCRM 6.2-5 with Amazon SQS through API or SDK provides a seamless communication channel between the two systems. In this integration, SugarCRM sends messages to an SQS queue that is subscribed by other systems like eCommerce platforms, help desk systems, and other third-party applications. These systems can then process the messages and update the CRM accordingly.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>Furthermore, the integration promotes scalability by allowing businesses to add third-party applications and services as needed. It also provides more robust security since sensitive data is communicated through a secure channel.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of SugarCRM 6.2-5 with Amazon SQS through API or SDK is a smart choice for businesses that seek to improve their customer data management and communication across different systems. It promotes automation and scalability, enhances data security, and increases efficiency by reducing manual work. Therefore, businesses should consider implementing this integration to take full advantage of its benefits.</p>
