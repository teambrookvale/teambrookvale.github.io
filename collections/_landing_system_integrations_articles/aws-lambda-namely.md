<div class="arttext">	<h1>AWS Lambda and Namely Integration</h1>
	<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows developers to run their code without worrying about managing servers. Namely, on the other hand, is a cloud-based people operations platform which helps HR teams manage employee data, payroll, benefits, and more. By integrating AWS Lambda with Namely through an API or SDK, organizations can automate the management of employee data and improve their HR processes.</p>

	<h2>API or SDK Integration</h2>
	<p>To integrate AWS Lambda with Namely, developers can either use the REST API provided by Namely or use the SDKs available for various programming languages. The API provides a set of endpoints which can be used to retrieve, create, update, or delete employee data in Namely. The SDKs, on the other hand, provide a set of libraries which can be used to interact with the API in a more convenient and efficient way. Developers can choose the approach which suits their needs and preferences.</p>

	<h2>Problem Solved</h2>
	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and Namely can solve several problems faced by organizations in managing their employee data. Some of these problems are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Manual data entry: HR teams often spend a lot of time manually entering employee data into multiple systems. This can lead to errors, inconsistencies, and wasted time.</li>
		<li>Data synchronization: When employee data is updated in one system, it needs to be synchronized with other systems to ensure that all data is up-to-date. This can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.</li>
		<li>Lack of automation: Many HR processes are still manual, which can lead to inefficiencies and delays in decision-making. Automating these processes can help HR teams be more productive and responsive.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and Namely through an API or SDK can help organizations automate their HR processes and improve the management of employee data. By eliminating manual data entry, improving data synchronization, and enabling automation, HR teams can focus on more strategic tasks that add value to the organization. Overall, the integration of AWS Lambda and Namely can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HR operations.</p>
