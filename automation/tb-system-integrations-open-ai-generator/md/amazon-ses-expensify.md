			<h2>Introduction to Amazon SES and Expensify</h2>
			<p>Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) is a cloud-based email sending service that enables businesses and organizations to send millions of emails per day. It is a reliable and cost-effective way to send bulk emails such as newsletters, transactional emails, and marketing messages.</p>

			<p>Expensify is a web-based software that helps businesses and individuals manage their expenses, invoices, and receipts. It streamlines the expense reporting process by providing users with an easy-to-use interface and automated workflows. Expensify integrates with popular accounting software such as QuickBooks and Xero.</p>

		<!-- Integration -->
		<section>
			<h2>Integration of Amazon SES and Expensify through API/SDK</h2>
			<p>Amazon SES and Expensify can be integrated using their APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or SDKs (Software Development Kits). This allows businesses to send email notifications or receipts to their employees or customers regarding their expenses.</p>

			<p>For example, when an employee submits an expense report in Expensify, the business can use Amazon SES to send an email notification to the employee acknowledging receipt of the report. Similarly, when an expense is approved or rejected by a manager, Amazon SES can be used to send an email notification to the employee informing them of the decision.</p>

			<p>The integration can be customized to meet the specific needs of the business or organization. Advanced features such as auto-reminders, notification escalation, and attachment handling can be added using APIs or SDKs.</p>
