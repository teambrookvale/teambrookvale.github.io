Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network that delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally.</p>

  <h2>Integration of Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon CloudFront</h2>

  <p>You can integrate Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon CloudFront through the AWS SDK or the API. By doing so, you can monitor the performance of your content delivery network to gain insights into the factors affecting your customers' user experience.</p>

  <p>When you use Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon CloudFront together, you can get detailed metrics on how your content is being delivered. These metrics include:</p>
