<div class="arttext">	<h1>Integrating Keap Max Classic and Chargify</h1>
	<p>Keap Max Classic is a CRM software designed for small businesses to manage their customer relationships and automate their marketing efforts. Chargify, on the other hand, is a recurring billing and subscription management platform for businesses that offer subscription-based products or services.</p>
	<p>The two platforms can be integrated through API or SDK, allowing businesses to automate their billing and subscription management processes while also managing their customer relationships through Keap Max Classic.</p>
	<h2>API vs SDK</h2>
	<p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. On the other hand, an SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of software development tools and libraries that allow developers to build applications for a specific platform.</p>
	<p>In the case of Keap Max Classic and Chargify integration, businesses can use the Chargify API to connect the two platforms and automate their billing and subscription management. Alternatively, they can use the Chargify SDK to build their own custom application that integrates with Keap Max Classic.</p>
