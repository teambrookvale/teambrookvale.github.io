Additionally, the integration can help businesses track customer behavior and preferences, allowing them to deliver personalized experiences. Furthermore, the integration can assist businesses in identifying patterns and trends in their data, enabling them to optimize their marketing campaigns and increase sales.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
