	<h1>The Power of Integrating AWS Lambda and ServiceNow</h1>
	<p>As more and more companies move their operations to the cloud, the need for seamless integration between various services becomes increasingly important. One example of a powerful integration is between AWS Lambda and ServiceNow.</p>
	<h2>What is AWS Lambda?</h2>
	<p>AWS Lambda is a computing service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is a serverless platform, meaning that you don't have to worry about infrastructure when you write and deploy your code. With AWS Lambda, you can build applications that respond quickly to new updates and are easy to scale.</p>
	<h2>What is ServiceNow?</h2>
	<p>ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that provides IT service management (ITSM), IT operations management (ITOM), and IT business management (ITBM) services. It enables enterprises to manage their IT services in an efficient and streamlined manner.</p>
	<h2>Integration of AWS Lambda and ServiceNow</h2>
	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and ServiceNow can be done through either API or SDK. When using an API integration, ServiceNow calls an AWS Lambda function and passes data to it. The function in turn processes the data and sends the response back to ServiceNow. When using an SDK integration, you can use AWS Lambda as a platform for building custom ServiceNow applications.</p>
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and ServiceNow solves several problems. First, it enables seamless communication between the two platforms, ensuring that data is consistently updated and accurate. Second, it allows for the automation of tasks that were previously done manually, increasing efficiency and reducing the risk of error. Finally, it provides a simple way to build custom applications that integrate with both AWS Lambda and ServiceNow.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and ServiceNow is a powerful tool that can help enterprises manage their IT services in an efficient and streamlined manner. By enabling seamless communication, automating tasks, and providing a simple way to build custom applications, this integration can provide significant benefits to businesses of all sizes.</p>
