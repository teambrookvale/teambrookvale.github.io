	<h1>Integrating AI by Zapier with SQL Server through API or SDK: A Solution to Your Problems</h1>
	
	<p>AI or artificial intelligence is becoming a buzzword in the technology industry. It refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Zapier, on the other hand, is a web-based service that allows users to automate tasks between web applications. It integrates with over 1,500 web apps, including Google Sheets, Trello, and Slack. Now, imagine integrating AI by Zapier with your SQL Server database using an API or SDK. </p>
	
	<h2>Integration of AI by Zapier and SQL Server</h2>
	
	<p>AI by Zapier has several integrations with SQL Server using both API and SDK. Through its API integration, Zapier can connect to your SQL Server database to automate various tasks. For instance, it can add new rows to a table based on a trigger or condition, update existing rows, or even query data from your database based on specific criteria. Meanwhile, using the SDK integration allows developers to build custom integrations between AI by Zapier and SQL Server to meet specific business requirements.</p>
	
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	
	<p> Integrating AI by Zapier with SQL Server via API or SDK can solve various problems, including the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Automation of repetitive tasks such as data entry, updating records, or sending notifications about data changes to relevant stakeholders. </li>
		<li>Real-time synchronization of data between AI by Zapier and SQL Server. This ensures that any changes made in SQL Server are immediately reflected in AI by Zapier and vice versa, eliminating data discrepancies or duplication. </li>
		<li>Reducing the time and resources required to create custom integrations. With the existing API and SDK integration, developers can easily build their integrations specific to their business requirements without creating one from scratch. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	
	<p> Integrating AI by Zapier with SQL Server through API or SDK is a powerful solution that solves various business problems. From automating repetitive tasks to real-time data synchronization, their integration ensures that crucial data is available to stakeholders in real-time, driving better decision-making. </p>
