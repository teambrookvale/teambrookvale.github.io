	<p>As businesses move to remote work, online training and webinars have become a necessity. GoTo Training is a popular platform for conducting online training sessions. However, with the increasing number of participants, monitoring and managing the training sessions can become cumbersome. This is where Amazon CloudWatch comes in.</p>

	<h2>Amazon CloudWatch</h2>
	<p>Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides metrics and logs about resources and applications running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to gain insights into the performance and health of your applications and resources, and detect and resolve issues quickly.</p>

	<h2>GoTo Training</h2>
	<p>GoTo Training is an online training and webinar platform that allows for easy creation and delivery of virtual training sessions. It enables businesses to provide remote training to employees, customers, and partners. With GoTo Training, participants can join from anywhere, and trainers can conduct interactive sessions using features like polls, quizzes, and breakout rooms.</p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon CloudWatch and GoTo Training can be done using APIs or SDKs. Amazon CloudWatch API can be used to programmatically access Amazon CloudWatch monitoring data for your resources. You can use the Amazon CloudWatch API to retrieve data for custom metrics or alarms, create new alarms, and manage existing alarms. Similarly, GoTo Training SDK can be used to integrate GoTo Training with other applications and platforms.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>Integrating Amazon CloudWatch with GoTo Training can solve several problems faced by businesses during online training sessions.
