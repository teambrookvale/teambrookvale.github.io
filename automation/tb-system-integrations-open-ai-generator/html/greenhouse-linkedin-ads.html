	<h1>Greenhouse and LinkedIn Ads Integration</h1>
	<p>Greenhouse is an applicant tracking system (ATS) that helps companies manage their recruiting process. It offers tools for job posting, candidate management, interview scheduling, and more. LinkedIn Ads, on the other hand, is a platform for advertising on LinkedIn. It allows companies to create ads that target specific audiences based on job titles, industries, and other criteria.</p>
	<p>Integrating Greenhouse and LinkedIn Ads through an API or SDK allows recruiters to access LinkedIn's pool of professionals who are actively looking for jobs. The integration also allows for better tracking of candidate sources, so recruiters can identify which job postings and advertising campaigns are generating the most quality candidates.</p>
	<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>
	<p>Without integration, recruiters would have to manually create job postings on LinkedIn, track candidate sources separately, and manage candidate information in both Greenhouse and LinkedIn. This can be time-consuming and prone to errors. With integration, recruiters can manage everything in one place and streamline their recruiting process.</p>
	<p>Another challenge that integration solves is candidate engagement. When a candidate applies through a job posting on LinkedIn, their information can be automatically added to Greenhouse. This allows recruiters to quickly reach out to candidates and keep them engaged throughout the recruiting process.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Greenhouse and LinkedIn Ads is a valuable solution for recruiters who want to streamline their recruiting process and reach a larger pool of qualified candidates. By utilizing an API or SDK, the integration allows for better tracking of candidate sources, automatic addition of candidate information, and more efficient management of the recruiting process as a whole.</p>
