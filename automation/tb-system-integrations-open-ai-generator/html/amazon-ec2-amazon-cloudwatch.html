    <h1>Integration of Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudWatch</h1>
    <p>Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and Amazon CloudWatch are two important AWS services that help in launching, managing, and monitoring the cloud computing infrastructure. EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud, while CloudWatch is a monitoring service that provides metrics, logs, and alarms for the AWS resources. </p>
    
    <h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>The integration of Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudWatch can be done through the API or SDK. The API allows the users to access the CloudWatch monitoring data from EC2 instances or other AWS resources. The SDK provides a set of libraries and tools for developers to integrate CloudWatch features into their applications or services. </p>
    
    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>The integration of EC2 and CloudWatch solves many problems related to monitoring and scaling of the AWS resources. Some of the problems include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitoring EC2 instances in real-time</li>
      <li>Setting up alarms for specific metrics and thresholds</li>
      <li>Automatically scaling EC2 instances based on demand and load</li>
      <li>Tracking logs and events for debugging and auditing purposes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Amazon EC2</h2>
    <p>Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. EC2 allows users to launch virtual machines (instances) with various configurations, such as operating system, CPU, memory, storage, and network settings. EC2 is highly scalable and flexible, enabling users to increase or decrease computing capacity as per their requirements.</p>
    
    <h2>Amazon CloudWatch</h2>
    <p>Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS resources and the applications running on them. It collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various sources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, ELB load balancers, and S3 buckets. CloudWatch provides real-time insights into the performance and health of the resources, and allows users to set up alarms and notifications for specific events or conditions. CloudWatch also integrates with other AWS services, such as Auto Scaling, to enable automatic scaling of resources based on the metrics.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The integration of Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudWatch provides a powerful set of tools for managing and monitoring the AWS infrastructure. With the API or SDK, developers can easily access and use the CloudWatch features from within their applications or services running on EC2 instances. This integration helps in maintaining high availability, reliability, and performance of the cloud resources, and enables users to react quickly to any issues or changes in the system.</p>
