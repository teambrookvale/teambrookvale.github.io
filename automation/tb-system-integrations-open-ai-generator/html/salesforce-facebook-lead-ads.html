These two tools might seem unrelated, but they can work together seamlessly through API or SDK integration.</p>

	<h2>Integration of Salesforce and Facebook Lead Ads</h2>

This eliminates the need for manual data entry and ensures that all leads are captured in one central place.</p>

	<p>There are two ways to integrate Salesforce and Facebook Lead Ads: API or SDK. The API integration involves using Salesforce's API to connect to Facebook Lead Ads. The SDK integration involves using Facebook's SDK to connect to Salesforce. Both options are easy to set up and can be done without any coding knowledge.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
