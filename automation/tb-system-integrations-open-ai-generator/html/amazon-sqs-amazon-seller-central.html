	<h2>Integration of the Two</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon SQS and Seller Central can be achieved through the use of APIs or SDKs. By utilizing Amazon SQS, you can enable a seller's system to automatically prioritize and fulfill orders based on their urgency and importance. Through Seller Central's API, the merchant can receive notifications from the SQS queue, and process the orders accordingly.</p>
	<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>
	<p>By integrating SQS and Seller Central, you can eliminate the need for manual order prioritization and fulfillment. The system automatically identifies and processes critical orders, improving operational efficiency and reducing the risk of errors. This integration ensures quick and reliable order fulfillment, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Integrating Amazon SQS and Seller Central can help merchants to achieve greater success and profitability on Amazon, by enabling them to streamline their operations and automate key processes.
