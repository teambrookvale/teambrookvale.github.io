			<h2>What is Amazon SNS?</h2>
			<p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a message and notification service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, serverless applications, and event-driven computing.</p>
			<p>With Amazon SNS, you can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Publish messages to topics or directly to individual Amazon SNS endpoints, such as Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, email addresses, and mobile devices</li>
				<li>Send SMS messages to more than 200 countries and regions</li>
				<li>Create message filtering policies that use attributes to route messages to different endpoints</li>
				<li>Encrypt messages in transit and at rest</li>
				<li>Use cloud-native integration with other AWS services, such as AWS CloudFormation, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS CloudWatch</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Notify Amazon SNS topics or endpoints when a customer signs up or cancels a subscription, or when a payment fails or succeeds in Chargify.</li>
				<li>Use Amazon SNS to trigger webhooks or serverless functions that process the notification message and take appropriate action, such as updating a CRM or sending a follow-up email.</li>
			</ul>
