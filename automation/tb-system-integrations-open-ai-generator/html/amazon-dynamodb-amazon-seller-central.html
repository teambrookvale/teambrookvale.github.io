	<p>Sellers who use both Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Seller Central can integrate the two services using APIs or SDKs. This integration allows sellers to store their product and sales data in DynamoDB and then use the data to manage their inventory and sales in Seller Central. This integration provides easier access to data, simplifies order management, and enables faster decision-making.</p>
