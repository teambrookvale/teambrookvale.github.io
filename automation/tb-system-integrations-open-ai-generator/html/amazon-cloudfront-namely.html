	<h1>Integration of Amazon CloudFront and Namely</h1>
	<p>Many companies depend on cloud computing services to improve their data processing and storage capabilities. Two popular cloud computing services are Amazon CloudFront and Namely. Both services have specific features that can benefit companies, but what if they could work together? This is where API and SDK come into play. </p>

	<h2>Amazon CloudFront</h2>
	<p>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) provided by Amazon Web Services. This service allows companies to distribute content globally by caching it on multiple servers around the world. This helps companies deliver content faster with low latency and high data transfer speeds.</p>

	<h2>Namely</h2>
	<p>Namely is a cloud-based human resources (HR) management platform. The platform provides HR solutions such as payroll, benefits administration, and talent management. Namely also enables a company to improve employee engagement, create HR reports, and streamline HR processes.</p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>By integrating Amazon CloudFront and Namely through API or SDK, companies can leverage their full potential. With Amazon CloudFront, files and content from Namely's web application can be cached locally, allowing faster load times. Additionally, this integration allows Namely to leverage Amazon CloudFront's ability to distribute and cache content, which can help improve the speed and performance of the application.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>One of the main challenges that companies face is delivering fast, reliable, and secure content to their employees. By integrating Amazon CloudFront and Namely, companies can achieve this goal. With Amazon CloudFront, companies can cache and deliver content faster to employees from Namely's web application. This integration also enables Namely to leverage Amazon CloudFront's security features, such as SSL/TLS certificates, which can help improve the security of employee data.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon CloudFront and Namely is an excellent example of how APIs and SDKs can improve business processes and deliver better services. By caching content from Namely's web application, Amazon CloudFront can deliver content faster with low latency and high data transfer speeds. Integrating these two services can also help improve employee engagement, streamline HR processes, and increase the security of employee data. </p>
