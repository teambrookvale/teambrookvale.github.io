    <h1>Amazon CloudWatch and Lambda Integration</h1>
    <p>
      Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service offered by Amazon Web Services
      (AWS) for serving applications, systems, and services running on AWS Use this
      service to monitor various resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, applications,
      and custom metrics they generate or to automate some processes or respond to various
      system events using AWS Lambda functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code in
      response to events and automatically manages the resources required by that code.
      With this service, imagine creating and executing your application's backend or server
      infrastructure without provisioning servers upfront. AWS Lambda has become one of the
      primary services in building serverless architecture. It offers integrations with over
      170 AWS services, including Amazon CloudWatch.
    </p>
    <h2>Integration with API or SDK</h2>
    <p>
      The integration of Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Lambda allows developers and IT teams
      to create serverless architectures for automated resource monitoring. This integration can
      be done using APIs or SDKs. Using the AWS CloudWatch API, users can retrieve the data of the various services they use and Amazon CloudWatch can monitor these services. On the other hand, integrating AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudWatch using the SDK can directly process and analyze data from logs generated by AWS Lambda. Furthermore, if you have existing applications or systems, you can monitor them as well by creating custom metrics and using the Amazon CloudWatch API or SDK to compile and visualize statistics.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems solved by this Integration</h2>
    <p>
      The integration of Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Lambda is essential for serverless
      architectures as it can solve various problems that developers and IT teams might face.
      First, the two services can work together to monitor the new serverless infrastructure,
      visibility, and performance. Second, Amazon CloudWatch can act as a notification service
      where it can notify either individuals or specific IT teams about resource usage, errors, or
      other user-defined metrics. Finally, the two services can aid in generating reports and
      dashboards to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize serverless applications and systems.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In summary, the integration of Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Lambda offers numerous
      benefits to application and system developers. With this integration, AWS CloudWatch and
      AWS Lambda work together to ensure constant monitoring and automation of resource usage,
      error reporting, and overall performance improvements. This seamless integration is one of
      the primary reasons why AWS Lambda has become one of the top serverless compute services
      on the market. By integrating these two essential services, AWS gives more significant benefits
      to users, improves visibility, and eases the transition from traditional application management
      to serverless architectures.
