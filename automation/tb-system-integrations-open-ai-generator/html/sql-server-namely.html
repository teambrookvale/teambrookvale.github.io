	<h1>Integration of SQL Server and Namely through API or SDK</h1>
	<p>SQL Server and Namely are two popular tools used for managing database and HR activities respectively. SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft while Namely is a cloud-based HR software platform designed for mid-sized companies.</p>
	<p>Integrating the two tools through API or SDK enables users to seamlessly transfer data between the systems, making it easier to manage employee information and generate reports in real time.</p>
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>Prior to the integration of SQL Server and Namely, users had to manually enter employee data into both systems, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. Moreover, generating reports and analyzing data required manual inputs from different sources, making it difficult for users to arrive at insights quickly.</p>
	<p>However, by integrating SQL Server and Namely through API or SDK, users can easily share and sync data between the systems. This leads to an increase in productivity, reduction in data errors, and overall better decision-making with real-time access to important information.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of SQL Server and Namely through API or SDK provides users with a seamless and efficient way to manage employee data. By eliminating manual inputs, reducing data errors, and providing real-time access to information, users are able to increase their productivity, make better decisions, and ultimately, drive business growth.</p>
