In this blog post, we will explore the integration of Magento 2.X and ServiceNow and the problems it solves.

<h3>Integration through API or SDK</h3>
To integrate Magento 2.X and ServiceNow, developers can use APIs provided by both platforms. Magento 2.X provides REST and SOAP APIs for integration, while ServiceNow provides REST APIs.
