	<p>Both Google Groups and Salesforce are popular tools used by businesses to increase productivity and streamline their operations. While they serve different functions, integrating them through API or SDK can solve a number of problems and lead to many benefits.</p>

	<h2>Google Groups</h2>

It is popularly used by businesses for internal communication and collaboration. Google Groups can be customized and configured depending on the needs of the group.

	<h2>Salesforce</h2>

	<p>Salesforce is a customer relationship management (CRM) software used by businesses to manage their contacts, sales, and customer interactions.

It is also highly customizable and can be integrated with other tools to enhance its usability.</p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>Integrating Google Groups and Salesforce can be done through Application Programming Interface (API) or Software Development Kit (SDK).

It facilitates communication among team members and ensures that customer data is up-to-date and accurate. It also provides a more comprehensive view of customer interactions, which leads to better decision-making.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The integration of Google Groups and Salesforce is a powerful tool that can benefit any business.
