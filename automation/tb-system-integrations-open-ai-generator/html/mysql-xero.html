    <h2>MySQL</h2>
    <p>MySQL is a free open-source relational database management system that runs on various platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. It is a reliable and scalable database that can handle large amounts of data and support multiple users. Its features include data integrity, security, and ease of use. MySQL is widely used in web development, e-commerce, and software applications.</p>

    <h2>Xero</h2>

    <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>Integration of MySQL and Xero through API or SDK allows businesses to automate the transfer of financial data between the two systems. Through this integration, businesses can save time and resources as they no longer have to manually enter and reconcile financial data. APIs provide a standard way of connecting software systems without the need for custom integration. SDKs, on the other hand, are pre-built software development kits that simplify the integration process. </p>

    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>Integration of MySQL and Xero through API or SDK solves several problems for businesses. One of which is data entry errors, which can occur when manually entering financial data into multiple systems. Integration ensures that data is transferred accurately and in real-time, reducing the likelihood of errors. Another problem is the lack of visibility of financial data, which can result in delays in decision making and reporting. Integration makes financial data visible and available in real-time, allowing businesses to make informed decisions and report financial data accurately and timely.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Integration of MySQL and Xero through API or SDK has become essential for businesses that want to simplify accounting tasks and streamline operations. It offers benefits such as automation, real-time data, accuracy, and efficiency.
