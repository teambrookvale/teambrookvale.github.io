	<h1>Integrating Instagram Custom Audiences with WHMCS using API or SDK</h1>
	
	<p>If you’re looking to reach a specific audience on Instagram, then you might consider using Instagram Custom Audiences. This is a feature available for advertisers, which allows them to target specific users based on their engagement with your website, app, or Instagram page. </p>

	<p>On the other hand, WHMCS (Web Host Manager Complete Solution) is a popular web hosting automation and billing platform. It is designed for web hosting resellers who want to automate their processes and improve their business efficiency. </p>

	<p>By integrating Instagram Custom Audiences with WHMCS, you can reach your target audience more effectively and with less effort. This integration can be done using either the Instagram API (Application Programming Interface) or SDK (Software Development Kit). </p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>By integrating Instagram Custom Audiences with WHMCS, you can reach your target audience more quickly and effectively. This also reduces the time and effort required for manual targeting, which can also be costly.</p>

	<p>For instance, if you’re running a web hosting business, you might use this integration to advertise to users who have visited your website, but did not complete the checkout process. By using an Instagram ad, you can remind them to come back and make a purchase. </p>

	<p>Another example is targeting people who have already shown interest in your brand. For instance, you can target users who have liked or commented on your Instagram posts, or perhaps users who have interacted with one of your customer reviews. </p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Integrating Instagram Custom Audiences with WHMCS can help improve your business' sales and marketing strategies. It allows you to reach your target audience effectively and quickly. The integration can be done through Instagram API or SDK, depending on your preference. </p>
