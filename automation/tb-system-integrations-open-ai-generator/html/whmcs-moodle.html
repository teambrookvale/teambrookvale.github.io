    <h1>WHMCS and Moodle Integration</h1>
    <p>WHMCS (Web Host Manager Complete Solution) is an all-in-one client management, billing, and support solution for online businesses. Moodle, on the other hand, is an open-source learning management system used to develop and deliver online courses.</p>
    <p>Integration of the two systems through API or SDK can be beneficial for businesses that offer online courses and need to manage subscriptions or payments. When integrated, WHMCS can automatically assign users to Moodle courses based on their payment status, subscription level, or user group.</p>
    <p>Some of the problems the integration of WHMCS and Moodle solves include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manual management of course access: Without integration, the business owner or administrator would need to manually handle access to courses, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.</li>
      <li>Payment tracking: Integration allows for seamless payment tracking, removing the need for a separate payment gateway and streamlining the payment process for both the business and their clients.</li>
      <li>User management: Integration eliminates the need for separate user management systems, allowing for automatic user syncing and reducing the chance of user errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In conclusion, integrating WHMCS and Moodle through API or SDK can save time and reduce errors in managing course access, payment, and user management. This integration not only streamlines the payment process but also ensures that clients have a seamless experience when accessing courses on Moodle.</p>
