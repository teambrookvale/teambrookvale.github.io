PayPal is one of the most popular payment gateways out there, and for good reason - it's secure, easy to use, and widely accepted. However, integrating PayPal into your website or application can be a daunting task. This is where software development kits (SDKs) come in.</p>
	<h2>What is PayPal?</h2>
	<p>PayPal is a digital wallet that allows you to securely send and receive payments online. It works by linking your bank account or credit card to your PayPal account, making it easy to shop online, pay bills, or transfer money to friends and family. PayPal also offers seller protection, dispute resolution, and fraud prevention services to ensure that your transactions are safe and secure.</p>
	<h2>What is an SDK?</h2>
	<p>An SDK is a set of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers can use to integrate third-party services into their applications. SDKs help streamline the integration process by providing pre-built code that can be easily integrated into your codebase. This saves developers time and ensures that the integration is done correctly.</p>
