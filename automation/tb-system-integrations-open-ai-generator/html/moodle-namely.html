    <h1>Moodle and Namely Integration: Better Management</h1>
    <p>
      Moodle is a widely used learning management system that offers an array of features to support learning, training, and assessment. Namely, on the other hand, is a comprehensive HR platform that provides end-to-end solutions for employee management, payroll, and benefits administration. Though they seem to address different aspects of organizational functioning, their integration through API or SDK opens up new possibilities for seamless management.
    </p>
    <h2>How Integration Works</h2>
    <p>
      The integration of Moodle and Namely means that your HR team can quickly update employee records, course progress, and certifications without logging into multiple systems. With API or SDK, it's easy to ensure that user data is automatically synchronised between the two platforms. Your HR team can use Namely to create and edit employee profiles, access employee reports, manage salaries, and approve leave applications, which will automatically sync with Moodle.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems Integration Solves</h2>
    <p>
      Organizations that use Moodle for training often struggle with managing employee records. It can be challenging and time-consuming to manually update user accounts every time a new employee joins or an existing employee leaves the organization. With the integration of Namely and Moodle, this challenge can be overcome. Employee records can be automatically created, updated, and deactivated across both systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Integration also enables HR teams to track and manage employee progress on training courses and certifications. They can see what training has been completed, what certifications employees have earned, and what training is yet to be done. This visibility helps HR teams plan their employee development programs more effectively.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      It is no longer enough to have silos of information within an organization. Integrating Mooel and Namely provides better management of employee data and ensures HR teams have instant access to up-to-date information. Knowing that employee information is accurate, up-to-date, and being tracked by one system, saves time and increase peace of mind.
