	<p>Integrating PostgreSQL and Xero can be done through their application programming interface (API) or software development kit (SDK). The API allows the two systems to communicate with each other, while the SDK provides a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to easily build applications that use Xero's data.</p>

		<li>Seamless cashflow management - With the integration, businesses can easily track their cashflow and automate their invoicing and payment processes. This allows for a more streamlined and efficient cashflow management process.</li>
		<li>Improved decision-making - Having access to real-time financial data enables businesses to make informed decisions based on accurate information. This can lead to better financial performance and profitability.</li>
	</ul>
