	<p>There are several ways to integrate SQL Server and Amazon Seller Central. One way is through their APIs or SDKs, which allow developers to create custom integrations between the two systems. By using APIs or SDKs, businesses can automatically transfer data between the two platforms, which can help streamline business processes and increase efficiency.
