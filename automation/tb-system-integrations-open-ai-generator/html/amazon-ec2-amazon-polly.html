    <h1>Amazon EC2 and Amazon Polly integration</h1>
    <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a range of tools and services for cloud-based computing, storage, and analysis. Two services that can be integrated with ease are Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Polly.</p>
    <h2>Amazon EC2</h2>
    <p>Amazon EC2 is a scalable cloud computing service that allows developers to launch and manage virtual machines within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. This service is used to build and run scalable applications and websites.</p>
    <h2>Amazon Polly</h2>
    <p>Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. It can be used to convert text into spoken words in multiple languages and voices.</p>
    <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>The integration of Amazon EC2 and Amazon Polly can be achieved through the use of APIs or Software Development Kits (SDKs). Developers can access Amazon Polly through their Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and can use the API or SDK to convert text into speech and store it in Amazon S3, which can then be accessed through EC2 instances.</p>
    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>The integration of Amazon EC2 and Amazon Polly provides many benefits to developers, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Efficient and cost-effective way to convert text to speech</li>
      <li>Scalability and elasticity to meet the demands of the application or website</li>
      <li>Improved accessibility for users who may be visually impaired or have reading difficulties</li>
      <li>Customization of voices and languages for a better end-user experience</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Amazon EC2 and Amazon Polly are powerful tools that can be integrated to improve application and website accessibility. By using the APIs or SDKs provided by Amazon Web Services, developers can take advantage of these tools to convert text to speech efficiently and cost-effectively while maintaining scalability and customization options.</p>
