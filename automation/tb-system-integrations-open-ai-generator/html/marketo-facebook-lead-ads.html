	<h1>Marketo and Facebook Lead Ads: The Perfect Integration</h1>
	<h2>What is Marketo?</h2>
	<p>Marketo is a marketing automation platform that helps businesses of all sizes to engage with their customers and leads. It offers tools for email marketing, lead generation, and lead management. It also provides analytics and reporting to help businesses measure their success.</p>
	
	<h2>What are Facebook Lead Ads?</h2>
	<p>Facebook Lead Ads are a type of Facebook ad that allows businesses to collect leads directly from Facebook. Users can click on the ad, and a pre-populated form will appear, which they can fill out without leaving Facebook. This makes the lead generation process faster and simpler for both businesses and users.</p>
	
	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>Integrating Marketo and Facebook Lead Ads can be done through an API or SDK. By doing so, businesses can automatically send leads collected through Facebook Lead Ads directly to their Marketo account. This saves time and reduces manual data entry errors.</p>
	
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>One of the main problems that this integration solves is the manual transfer of data between Facebook Lead Ads and Marketo. Without an integration, businesses would have to manually download the leads collected through Facebook Lead Ads and then manually upload them to Marketo. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors.</p>
	
	<p>Another problem that this integration solves is the lack of visibility into the effectiveness of Facebook Lead Ads. By integrating with Marketo, businesses can see how the leads collected through Facebook Lead Ads are interacting with their other marketing efforts. This helps them to better understand their customers and make data-driven decisions about their marketing strategy.</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Marketo and Facebook Lead Ads through an API or SDK is a powerful tool that can help businesses save time and improve their marketing strategy. By automating the transfer of data between the two systems, businesses can focus on what they do best - providing value to their customers.</p>
