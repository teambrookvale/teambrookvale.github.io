The API allows developers to access Evernote's features and data, while the SDK offers a more comprehensive solution for integrating Evernote technologies into software applications.</p>
	<p>By integrating these two powerful platforms, businesses can streamline their workflows, improve team collaboration, and provide better customer experiences. So, if you're looking for a smoother, more organized way to manage your customer interactions and team workflow, integrating SugarCRM 7+ and Evernote Business might just be the solution you need.</p>
