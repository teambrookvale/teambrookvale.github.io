	</header>
	<main>
		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies are changing the way people do business by automating routine tasks and taking care of mundane activities. Moreover, digital payment systems help businesses receive and make payments seamlessly, irrespective of their geographical location. Zapier, a web-based automation tool, allows businesses to connect various apps and tools they use, further simplifying their daily workflow. </p>
		<p>Zapier offers “Zaps” — an event-triggered automation between two or more tools or apps, which it calls “integrations.” PayPal is an online payment system that offers secure transactions, which is popularly used for cross-border eCommerce transactions. With Zapier's PayPal integration, it becomes easier for businesses to manage their PayPal transactions, keep track of finances, and automate time-consuming tasks that they're required to perform on a weekly, if not daily, basis.</p>
		<h2>Integration of AI by Zapier and PayPal</h2>
		<p>Zapier’s AI system understands the behavior of users and can help them with predictive functions. It also helps businesses make informed decisions based on insights it generates. PayPal, on the other hand, has been integrated with Zapier’s AI system which allows merchants to identify potential fraud before transactions get completed. In turn, this helps reduce the likelihood of fraudulent activity and ensures that businesses receive payments securely.</p>
		<p>Zapier’s integration with PayPal through an API or Software Development Kit (SDK) is seamless, where businesses can create automated workflows for their PayPal transactions akin to their preferences. Zapier allows businesses to create “trigger-action” automated workflows by connecting PayPal with other apps like Salesforce, Slack or Quickbooks, and automating tasks such as creating invoices, tracking expenses, and triggering automated emails on successful payments or reminders for overdue invoice payments.</p>
		<h2>Solving Problems Businesses May Face</h2>
		<p>The integration of Zapier’s AI and PayPal is a significant game-changer for smaller eCommerce businesses since it offers secure payment transactions and also ensures faster completion of tasks—reducing manual intervention and time-to-market. It’s essential to remember that a significant number of payment transactions still happen offline, and this move towards digitization can potentially save businesses time and money in the long run.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, it allows businesses to keep a real-time track of their finances, and also automate the financial processes. It ensures they comply with compliance regulations by providing accurate financial records. It also enables businesses to offer unique incentives, programs that attract and retain customers by running contests, incentives, and referral schemes and awards such as discounts, loyalty points, etc.</p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>The Zapier-AI and PayPal integration is a perfect example of how two different tech verticals can come together and create value for businesses worldwide. The integration is a step towards digital transformation, enabling businesses to automate their processes, ensure a smooth experience between the seller, and the buyer along with reliable payment channels. Furthermore, it is imperative for businesses to choose automation tools with the potential to scale and integrate with other solutions, creating a seamless ecosystem that helps them achieve their business goals.</p>
