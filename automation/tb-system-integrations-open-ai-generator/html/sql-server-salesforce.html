	<h1>Integrating SQL Server and Salesforce</h1>
	<p>SQL Server and Salesforce are two widely used technologies in the world of business. Salesforce provides a CRM solution and SQL Server is a database management system. Both are crucial for the smooth functioning of an organization.</p>
	<p>However, there are times when data needs to be shared between the two systems. This is where API or SDK come into play. Both technologies provide the means to integrate SQL Server and Salesforce seamlessly.</p>
	<h2>API Integration</h2>
	<p>Using API integration, the data can be shared between the two systems. The information is made available through a common interface and can be accessed as needed. This integration enables businesses to access relevant information faster and more accurately.</p>
	<h2>SDK Integration</h2>
	<p>SDK integration is another way to integrate SQL Server and Salesforce. SDKs provide developers with the necessary components to build applications that can access data from both systems. It assists in developing applications that integrate SQL Server and Salesforce without the need for extensive coding.</p>
	<h2>Problems Solved through Integration</h2>
	<p>The integration of SQL Server and Salesforce allows businesses to share data between the two systems more efficiently. The information shared includes customer contact details, sales activities, and financial transactions. With the integration, businesses can reap the following benefits:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Improved efficiency in managing customer data</li>
		<li>Real-time and accurate data access</li>
		<li>Enhanced reporting capabilities</li>
		<li>Improved decision-making processes</li>
		<li>Reduced data entry errors</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of SQL Server and Salesforce through API or SDK provides an opportunity to streamline business processes. The integration improves efficiency, accuracy, and reduces errors which ultimately lead to better decision-making processes. In todayâ€™s competitive world, having the right tools and information at your disposal can make all the difference. The integration of these technologies offers just that, making it a must-have solution for any organization that wants to remain competitive.</p>
