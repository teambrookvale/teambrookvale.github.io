	<h1>Integrating Facebook Custom Audiences with Custom Audiences</h1>
	<p>Facebook Custom Audiences is a powerful tool that allows businesses to target specific groups of users based on their actions and interests on Facebook. It allows advertisers to create audience segments based on a variety of factors including website behavior, email lists, app activity, and more.</p>
	<p>Custom Audiences, on the other hand, is a tool that enables advertisers to upload and target a list of user data like email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, and more.</p>
	<p>What if we could combine the power of both tools? The integration of Facebook Custom Audiences and Custom Audiences is possible through API or SDK.</p>
	<p>One of the main problems that the integration of both tools solves is targeting users across multiple platforms. Let's say a user is signed up for a newsletter using an email address. If that email address matches with a Facebook account, advertisers can now target that user with ads on both platforms. This increases the chances of converting a lead into a customer.</p>
	<p>Another problem that this integration solves is reaching out to users who have taken specific actions on your website. For instance, a visitor who has abandoned their cart can now be targeted with a Facebook ad reminding them to complete the purchase. This is possible through Facebook's website custom audiences.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Facebook Custom Audiences with Custom Audiences is a game-changer for advertisers. It allows them to target specific groups of users across multiple platforms and increases the chances of converting leads into customers. By using API or SDK, advertisers can now take advantage of the benefits that both tools offer and create a more effective advertising campaign.</p>
