    <h1>Greenhouse and Google BigQuery Integration</h1>
    <p>Greenhouse is a popular Applicant Tracking System (ATS) used by companies to manage their recruitment process. It offers a variety of features for posting job openings, reviewing resumes, scheduling interviews, and more. Google BigQuery, on the other hand, is a cloud-based data warehouse that allows users to store and analyze large amounts of data in real-time.</p>
    
    <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>Greenhouse and Google BigQuery can be integrated through APIs or SDKs (Software Development Kits). The integration allows recruiters to seamlessly import candidate data from Greenhouse into BigQuery for analysis and reporting. This means that recruiters can easily access and analyze candidate data, such as application history, interview scores, and more.</p>

    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>Before this integration, recruiters had to manually export data from Greenhouse and import it into BigQuery. This was a time-consuming process that was prone to errors. Additionally, recruiters had to rely on multiple tools to manage their recruitment process and analyze data, which could lead to inconsistencies in data and reporting. The integration of Greenhouse and Google BigQuery solves these problems by allowing recruiters to easily analyze candidate data in one platform.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The integration of Greenhouse and Google BigQuery provides a streamlined and efficient solution for recruiters to manage their recruitment process and analyze candidate data. It eliminates the need for manual data entry and reduces the likelihood of errors in data reporting. With the integration, recruiters can focus on the most important aspects of their job â€“ finding the best candidate for the position. </p>
