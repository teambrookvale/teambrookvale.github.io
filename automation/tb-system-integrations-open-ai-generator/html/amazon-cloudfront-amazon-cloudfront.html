			<h2>Amazon CloudFront</h2>
			<p>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to securely deliver data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds from edge locations.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Lambda@Edge</h2>
			<p>Lambda@Edge is a service that lets you run code in response to CloudFront events. It allows developers to execute serverless functions at CDN edge locations in response to various HTTP requests, such as viewer requests, origin requests, and response requests. Lambda@Edge extends the capabilities of CloudFront by letting developers customize the CDN's behavior.</p>

			<h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>
			<p>The integration of Amazon CloudFront and Lambda@Edge can be done through the CloudFront API or AWS SDKs. The API and SDKs provide a programmatic way to create, configure, and manage CloudFront distributions with customized Lambda@Edge functions. Developers can write Lambda functions in Node.js, Python, or Java, and they can deploy them using the AWS CloudFormation or AWS CLI.</p>

			<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>
			<p>The integration of Amazon CloudFront and Lambda@Edge solves several problems, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Improved Website Performance:</strong> With Lambda@Edge, developers can customize CloudFront's caching and delivery behavior by adding logic to handle viewer requests, origin requests, and response requests. This can help reduce the load on the origin server and improve website performance.</li>
				<li><strong>Reduced Infrastructure Costs:</strong> Developers can use Lambda@Edge to implement functionality that would otherwise require additional infrastructure, such as image resizing, URL rewriting, and security filtering. This can help reduce infrastructure costs and simplify the deployment process.</li>
				<li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> Lambda@Edge makes it easy to add security features to CloudFront distributions, such as IP blocking, rate limiting, and authentication. This can help prevent malicious traffic from reaching the origin server and protect sensitive data.</li>
			</ul>
