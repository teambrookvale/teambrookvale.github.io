	<h1>Integrating SQL Server and Webhooks by Zapier</h1>
	
	<p>SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for storing and managing data for various applications. Webhooks by Zapier, on the other hand, is a tool that allows you to receive real-time webhooks and trigger actions based on these events. </p>

	<p>The integration of these two tools can be done through API or SDK. With API, you can connect SQL Server to Zapier's webhook app by sending data to a Zapier endpoint. On the other hand, SDK integration allows you to create a custom Zapier app that connects your SQL Server database to your Zapier account. </p>

	<p>Integrating SQL Server and Webhooks by Zapier solves many problems. For instance, it allows you to automate data transfer between SQL Server and other applications. You can use it to trigger workflows in Zapier based on events that occur in your SQL Server database. For example, you can set up a workflow to automatically send an email notification or create a new entry in a Google sheet whenever a new record is added to a table in SQL Server.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Integrating SQL Server and Webhooks by Zapier is a powerful way to automate data transfer between applications. The integration allows you to create workflows based on database events in SQL Server and trigger actions in Zapier. This results in a seamless data flow and reduces the manual effort required to perform various tasks.</p>
