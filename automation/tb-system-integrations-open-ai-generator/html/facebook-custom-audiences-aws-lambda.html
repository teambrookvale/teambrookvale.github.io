<h2>Facebook Custom Audiences</h2>

<p>Facebook Custom Audiences is a targeting option that allows businesses to upload a list of contact information (such as email addresses or phone numbers) and reach those specific individuals with ads on Facebook. The platform also allows for the creation of "Lookalike Audiences," which are groups of people who share similar characteristics to the original Custom Audience, but may not have interacted with the business before.</p>

<h2>AWS Lambda</h2>

<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless platform that allows businesses to run code without managing servers. It can be used for a wide variety of applications, but when it comes to marketing, it can be used to automate tasks such as ad creation, audience targeting, and data analysis.</p>

<h2>Integration of the Two</h2>

<p>The integration of Facebook Custom Audiences and AWS Lambda can be done through an API or SDK. This allows businesses to automate their marketing efforts even further, as they no longer have to manually upload their Custom Audience lists or create new Lookalike Audiences. By connecting the two, businesses can create a continuous flow of data between the two platforms, allowing for more timely and accurate targeting.</p>

<h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>

<p>When used together, Facebook Custom Audiences and AWS Lambda can solve many common problems that businesses face in their marketing efforts. For example:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>By integrating these two tools, businesses can automate many of these tasks and focus on other aspects of their marketing strategy.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
