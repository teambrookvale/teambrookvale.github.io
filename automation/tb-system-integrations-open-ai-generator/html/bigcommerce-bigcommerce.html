	<h1>Integration of HubSpot and BigCommerce</h1>
	<p>HubSpot is a leading inbound marketing software platform that enables businesses to attract, engage, and delight customers. BigCommerce is one of the best e-commerce platforms that allow businesses to create customized online stores.</p>
	<p>The integration of HubSpot and BigCommerce has made it easier for businesses to manage their online stores and streamline their marketing efforts. The integration can be achieved through API or SDK, which allows the two platforms to communicate and share data.</p>
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>Prior to their integration, businesses had to manually switch between the two platforms to manage their marketing campaigns and their online stores. This was not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and inconsistencies in data. The integration of HubSpot and BigCommerce solves these problems by creating a seamless connection between the two platforms.</p>
	<p>With the integration, businesses can easily track and analyze customer behavior on their online stores and use that data to create targeted marketing campaigns. For example, if a customer abandons their cart, the integration enables HubSpot to send automated emails to remind the customer of their pending purchase and offer relevant product recommendations. This can help businesses recover lost sales and improve customer satisfaction.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of HubSpot and BigCommerce is a game-changer for businesses that want to grow their online presence and increase their sales. By combining the power of inbound marketing and e-commerce, businesses can create a personalized shopping experience for their customers and improve their bottom line. If you're looking to take your e-commerce business to the next level, it's time to consider integrating HubSpot and BigCommerce.</p>
