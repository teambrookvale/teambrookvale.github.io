<h2>Google Ads</h2>

<p>Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords, is an advertising platform developed by Google.

<h2>Amazon DynamoDB</h2>

<p>Amazon DynamoDB is a fully-managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data, regardless of the size or scale of the data. DynamoDB offers features such as automatic scaling, global tables, and backup and restore.</p>

<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>

<p>The integration of Google Ads and Amazon DynamoDB can be achieved through the use of APIs or SDKs. API stands for Application Programming Interface, which allows two different applications to communicate with each other. SDK stands for Software Development Kit, which is a collection of software development tools that allow developers to create applications for a specific platform.</p>
