	<main>
		<p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Structured Query Language (SQL) Server are two vital business tools that management and employees require to keep track of the operations in real-time. While CRM works to improve customer interactions and improve company relationships with customers, SQL Server keeps a record of important company data. However, it can be quite challenging to sync data between the two systems effectively without an API or SDK.</p>

		<h2>SQL Server</h2>
		<p>SQL Server is a relational database managing system from Microsoft used by businesses to store data and manage digital assets. SQL Server allows companies to organize data, run analytics, and manage data securely. </p>

		<h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>
		<p>API and SDK are used to link these two systems. Through API or SDK integration, data sharing between CRM and SQL is real-time and highly efficient. This integration ensures seamless transfer of data between the systems without any need for manual input, reducing errors that may occur during manual transfer thereby increasing productivity. </p>

		<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
		<p>Integration of CRM and SQL Server through API or SDK provides a solution to problems that businesses usually encounter. One significant problem is the inability to process customer data accurately. Employees spend a lot of time inputting customer data into several databases, which increases human error, time wastage, low productivity and decreased output. The integration also provides solutions to fragmented and inconsistent data. With integration, data transfer is streamlined into a single database, thus increasing accuracy, consistency and time-efficiency. </p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>CRM and SQL Server are vital business tools that every corporation needs. However, the ability to integrate the two allows for businesses to have an efficient, real-time and effortless exchange of data. API or SDK integration of CRM and SQL Server provides solutions to fragmented, inconsistent data and reduces human errors and time invested in manual data transfer.
