	<h1>Integration of Amazon S3 and SugarCRM 6.2-5</h1>
	<p>Amazon S3 is a popular cloud-based storage service that allows users to store and retrieve large amounts of data. SugarCRM is a customer relationship management software that helps businesses manage their customer interactions and improve customer relationships.</p>
	<p>The integration of Amazon S3 and SugarCRM is possible through the use of API or SDK. With this integration, users can easily access their Amazon S3 stored files directly from their SugarCRM account. This saves time and increases efficiency by eliminating the need to switch between multiple applications.</p>
	<p>One major problem that this integration solves is the issue of data storage. SugarCRM is limited in terms of data storage capabilities, making it difficult for businesses that need to manage large amounts of data. Amazon S3, on the other hand, provides unlimited storage capabilities which means that businesses can store as much data as they need. By integrating these two systems, businesses can easily manage their data in a seamless and efficient manner.</p>
