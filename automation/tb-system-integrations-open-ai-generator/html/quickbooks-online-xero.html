    <h1>Integrating QuickBooks Online and Xero through API or SDK</h1>
    <p>As cloud-based accounting software, QuickBooks Online and Xero are widely used by small to medium-sized businesses, freelancers, and accountants. While both platforms have their unique features and advantages, there are times when businesses want to integrate them for better efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
    <p>Both QuickBooks Online and Xero offer APIs (application programming interfaces) and SDKs (software development kits) that enable integration with other software or services.
