	<h1>ServiceNow and AWS Lambda Integration</h1>
	<p>ServiceNow is a cloud-based enterprise platform that offers various services to businesses such as IT service management, human resources management, and financial management. AWS Lambda, on the other hand, is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. While both services are useful on their own, their integration can lead to even more benefits for businesses.</p>
	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>ServiceNow and AWS Lambda can be integrated through API or SDK. By integrating through API, ServiceNow can trigger Lambda functions to perform tasks such as sending notifications or querying data. SDK integration allows developers to integrate Lambda functionality directly into ServiceNow workflows.</p>
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>Integrating ServiceNow and AWS Lambda can solve various problems faced by businesses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Improved efficiency:</strong> With the support of AWS Lambda, ServiceNow can automate processes that require computing power. This, in turn, reduces response time and increases efficiency, as tasks are completed faster and with minimal human intervention.</li>
		<li><strong>Better data management:</strong> ServiceNow can use Lambda functions to automate data collection and analysis, making it easier for businesses to track and manage their data. This ensures that data is accurate and up-to-date at all times, reducing the risk of errors.</li>
		<li><strong>Cost savings:</strong> Instead of having to invest in expensive computing infrastructure, businesses can use AWS Lambda to perform computing tasks on-demand. With ServiceNow integration, computing tasks can be automated, leading to cost savings in the long run.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>ServiceNow and AWS Lambda integration is a game-changer for businesses, providing automation and efficiency to various processes. By integrating the two, businesses can better manage their data, improve response time, and reduce cost. With the support of API or SDK, the possibilities of their integration are endless, and businesses can truly leverage the benefits of both services.</p>
