    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
    <p>
      Evernote Business has many features that make it an excellent tool for team collaboration, project management, note-taking, and more.

By integrating Evernote Business with GoTo Training, teams can easily organize their notes and materials, create reminders and notifications, and improve team communication.
      
      For example, a training program may involve creating a series of training materials, assigning tasks to team members, and tracking their progress. Evernote Business can be used to create and store training materials, assign tasks, and create to-do lists. The integration with GoTo Training makes it easy to schedule and deliver training sessions, track attendance, and get feedback from trainees.
