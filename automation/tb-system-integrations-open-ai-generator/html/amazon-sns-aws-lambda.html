	<h1>Integration of Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda</h1>
	<p>Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda are two of the most popular services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). While both services are powerful on their own, integrating them can enhance their functionality significantly.</p>

	<h2>Amazon SNS</h2>
	<p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a messaging service that allows you to send notifications and messages to a large number of recipients, including email, SMS text messages, and mobile push notifications. It is a fully managed service, which means you don't have to worry about scaling, reliability, or infrastructure management.</p>

	<h2>AWS Lambda</h2>
	<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It allows you to easily create and run applications that respond to events and automatically scale in response to traffic. With AWS Lambda, you can build serverless applications that can perform tasks such as processing data, generating reports, and executing business logic.</p>

	<h2>Integration of Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda can be achieved through either an API or an SDK. The API integrates SNS with Lambda by invoking a Lambda function whenever a message is sent to an SNS topic. The SDK allows you to invoke a Lambda function directly from your code, without having to go through SNS.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>By integrating Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda, you can build powerful applications that respond to messages and events in real-time. For example, you can set up a Lambda function to process incoming emails or SMS messages and perform actions such as sending notifications, updating databases, or calling external APIs. You can also use SNS to trigger Lambda functions in response to events such as changes in a database or updates to a file in Amazon S3.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda are two powerful services that can be used together to build scalable and responsive applications. Integrating the two services can enhance their functionality and solve many common problems, such as processing incoming messages and responding to events in real-time. AWS makes it easy to integrate its services, and the combination of Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda is no exception.</p>
