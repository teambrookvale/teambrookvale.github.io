<p>A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is an essential tool for any business to manage relationships with existing and potential customers. Some of the most popular CRM software in use today include Salesfoce, Zoho, HubSpot, and Solve CRM. However, even with the best CRM in place, there may be challenges like connectivity, data sync between various sources, and customization of workflows. In this blog post, we'll explore how Zapier Webhooks and Solve CRM integration through API and SDK can help solve these issues.</p>

<h2>Webhooks by Zapier</h2>

<p>Zapier is a web-based integration platform that allows inter-connectivity between various cloud-based applications. Zapier triggers a workflow in response to an event from an app, it passes data to another app, and the process continues. Webhooks are a powerful feature of Zapier that allow users to receive data about specific events or changes from an external source in real-time.</p>

<p>Webhooks allow 3rd party systems like Solve CRM to push data into Zapier's workflows, thus widening the automation possibilities. Custom triggers can be set for any application using webhooks on Zapier, making it an incredibly flexible tool.</p>

<h2>Solve CRM</h2>
