It is especially useful for applications that require low latency and can handle an unlimited amount of read and write operations per second.

		Magento 2.X is an open-source e-commerce platform that offers merchants the flexibility to manage the content, functionality, and layout of their online store. It allows merchants to create, update, and manage their store easily with various extensions, themes and customizations. Also, Magento 2.X has a strong presence in the digital commerce market.
