    <p>GoTo Webinar is a web-based platform that enables individuals and organizations to conduct online seminars, presentations, and meetings with a large number of participants. It provides features like screen sharing, recording, and polls.</p>

    <p>Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a cloud computing service that provides scalable computing capacity. It enables businesses to run their applications on a virtual machine (VM) called an "instance" in the cloud.</p>

    <p>Integrating GoTo Webinar with Amazon EC2 through API or SDK can solve a number of problems. For example:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatic Scaling:</strong> By integrating GoTo Webinar with Amazon EC2, one can easily scale the infrastructure based on the number of attendees. For example, if the number of attendees increases, more instances of the web server can be created automatically to handle the load.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Amazon EC2 provides a secure environment for hosting web applications. By integrating GoTo Webinar with EC2, webinars can be hosted on a secure environment, ensuring the privacy and security of the attendees.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost optimization:</strong> By using Amazon EC2, businesses can minimize their infrastructure costs. EC2 offers "pay as you go" pricing, ensuring that businesses only pay for the resources they use. By integrating GoTo Webinar with Amazon EC2, businesses can save on infrastructure costs while providing a seamless experience for the attendees.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In conclusion, integrating GoTo Webinar with Amazon EC2 is a great way to provide a seamless webinar experience for the attendees while minimizing infrastructure costs. It not only provides scalability and security but also enables businesses to optimize their infrastructure costs.
