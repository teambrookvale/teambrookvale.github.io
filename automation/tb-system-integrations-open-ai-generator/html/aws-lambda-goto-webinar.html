	<h2>What is AWS Lambda?</h2>
	<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform that enables developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With AWS Lambda, businesses can write code that runs automatically in response to events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an API call.</p>
	<h2>What is GoTo Webinar?</h2>
