	<p>Greenhouse is a popular applicant tracking system (ATS) used by many businesses and recruiters to manage their hiring process. GoTo Webinar, on the other hand, is a leading web conferencing and webinar solution. When these two powerful tools are integrated using APIs or SDKs, they become even more useful and effective in streamlining the recruitment process. </p>

These tools allow the two systems to communicate with each other, share data and information seamlessly. For instance, when a hiring manager schedules an interview using Greenhouse, this information is automatically communicated to GoTo Webinar, which sends an invitation to the candidate and allows them to join the interview. This integration eliminates the need for manual input of data, thus saving time and reducing errors.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of Greenhouse and GoTo Webinar solves many problems for hiring teams. For example, this integration ensures that the candidate experience is seamless and efficient.
