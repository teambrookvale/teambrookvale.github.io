	<h1>AWS Lambda and Twitter Integration</h1>
	<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to run code without the need to provision or manage servers, making it a popular choice for creating scalable applications. Twitter, on the other hand, is a social networking platform where users can express their thoughts and opinions in short messages called tweets. </p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>The two can be integrated using either the Twitter API or AWS SDK. The Twitter API allows developers to access Twitter's features and data, such as posting tweets, searching for tweets, and streaming tweets. AWS SDKs are software development kits that allow developers to access AWS services, including AWS Lambda, in their preferred programming language. </p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>Integrating AWS Lambda and Twitter can solve various problems, including automating tasks such as tweeting when a certain event occurs, monitoring tweets related to a particular topic, and analyzing tweets to gain insights. With the integration, developers can also build applications that respond to tweets, such as chatbots or sentiment analysis tools. </p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Integrating AWS Lambda and Twitter can open up a whole range of possibilities for developers. Whether it's automating tasks, monitoring tweets, or building applications that respond to tweets, the integration can solve various problems and add value to any business or individual using Twitter. </p>
