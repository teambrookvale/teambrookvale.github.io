		<li>Avoid Double Data Entry - The integration eliminates the need for HR personnel to manually enter employee data in both platforms separately, reducing the likelihood of data errors.</li>
		<li>Improved Reporting - Integration can help generate comprehensive reports about employee data, which can be used to identify areas where improvements can be made.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Overall, the integration of BambooHR and Namely through API or SDK helps HR departments to increase the efficiency of their operations and reduce the risk of errors. By using both solutions together, companies can have a comprehensive HR management system that covers many aspects of HR management.
