	<h2>Google Ads</h2>

	<p>Google Ads is an online advertising platform developed by Google. It allows businesses to place display ads, search ads, video ads and more across Google's various platforms including search results pages, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. Google Ads uses a pay-per-click (PPC) model, so businesses only pay when a user clicks on their ad</p>

	<h2>Shopify</h2>

	<p>Shopify is an all-in-one e-commerce platform that allows businesses to build their own online store, manage their inventory, process payments, and more. Shopify is used by businesses of all sizes, from small businesses to enterprise-level corporations.</p>

	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
