	<h2>Twitter</h2>
	<p>Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to share short text messages known as tweets. It has become an important platform for businesses and individuals to engage with customers and share information. Twitter users can follow other users, and their tweets appear on their timeline. Twitter has a powerful API that allows developers to access data from Twitter such as tweets, user information, and more.</p>
	
	<h2>MySQL</h2>
	<p>MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system used by businesses and web developers to store and manage data. MySQL is widely used because of its stability, high performance, and low cost. It supports Structured Query Language (SQL), which allows for easy querying and manipulation of data.

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>Twitter provides APIs and SDKs that allow developers to access Twitter data programmatically. Developers can use these APIs and SDKs to retrieve data from Twitter and store it in a MySQL database. This integration allows businesses and individuals to analyze Twitter data and gain insights into user behavior, preferences, trends, and more.</p>
