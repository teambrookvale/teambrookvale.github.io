<h2>Integration of the Two Through API or SDK</h2>

<p>Integrating Facebook Lead Ads and SugarCRM 7+ requires access to either the Facebook API or SDK (Software Development Kit).

SDK access allows for additional customization options and can aid in the creation of custom forms and ads.</p>

<h2>Problems Their Integration Solves</h2>
