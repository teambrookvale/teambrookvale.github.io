	<h1>Integration of AI by Zapier and PostgreSQL</h1>
	<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over many industries, automating tasks and reducing human errors. On the other hand, PostgreSQL is a popular open source relational database management system. The integration of these two technologies can benefit businesses by streamlining processes and improving data analysis.</p>
	<h2>AI by Zapier</h2>
	<p>Zapier is a platform that connects different software applications and automates workflows between them. AI by Zapier allows users to create custom workflows that utilize AI to automate tasks, analyze data, and make predictions.</p>
	<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
	<p>PostgreSQL is a powerful database system that can handle complex queries and large amounts of data. It is known for its reliability, scalability, and support for various data types and programming languages.</p>
	<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>Zapier offers an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows developers to build custom integrations with their software. Similarly, PostgreSQL has a wide range of SDKs (Software Development Kits) available for various programming languages.</p>
	<p>By integrating AI by Zapier with PostgreSQL, businesses can automate data entry, monitor social media for customer feedback, and analyze customer behavior. For example, a customer service team can use AI to automatically categorize customer inquiries and store them in PostgreSQL. This helps the team to respond faster and provide better customer service.</p>
	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
