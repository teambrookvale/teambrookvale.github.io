	<h1>Integrating Google BigQuery with Chargify</h1>

	<p>Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics platform, providing users with the ability to query and analyze large datasets in real-time. On the other hand, Chargify is a subscription billing platform that simplifies the complexities of subscription billing management.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>

	<p>The integration of Google BigQuery and Chargify can be achieved through API or SDK. The API (Application Programming Interface) allows programs or applications to communicate with each other, while the SDK (Software Development Kit) provides a set of tools that software developers can use to build applications. </p>

	<p>Using the API or SDK integrates Google BigQuery and Chargify, making it possible to easily analyze and manage subscription billing data. The integration ensures that all the billing data is available within the Google BigQuery platform, where it can be used for analysis and reporting.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

	<p>The integration of Google BigQuery and Chargify solves a variety of problems, including:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Real-time analysis of billing data – With the integration, it is possible to analyze billing data in real-time, providing insights into subscription billing patterns, trends, and anomalies.</li>
		<li>Billing data management – The integration of Google BigQuery and Chargify ensures that all billing data is stored in a centralized location, simplifying data management and analysis.</li>
		<li>Predictive modeling – The integration of Google BigQuery and Chargify enables predictive modeling of subscription billing behavior, helping to identify factors that lead to churn and improve retention.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Integrating Google BigQuery with Chargify through API or SDK provides businesses with the ability to manage, analyze and report on subscription billing data in real-time. This integration ensures that all billing data is stored in a centralized location, simplifying data analysis and management. Predictive modeling can be used to improve retention by identifying factors that lead to churn. Therefore, businesses using Chargify for subscription billing can benefit from integrating it with Google BigQuery.</p>
