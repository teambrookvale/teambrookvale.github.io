	<h1>Integration of Google BigQuery and GoTo Webinar </h1>
	<p>Google BigQuery is a cloud-based platform that enables developers to analyze large data sets in real-time. On the other hand, GoTo Webinar is a web-based platform that allows businesses to host interactive webinars and online events. </p>

	<p>Now, with the integration of the two through API or SDK, businesses can get real-time data insights from their webinars. This integration enables businesses to collect, process and analyze data from their webinars such as attendee information, engagement rates, and drop-off rates. This allows for better planning and better decision-making when it comes to organizing future webinars and events.</p>

	<p>One of the biggest problems that this integration solves is enabling businesses to save time and resources. Previously, businesses would have to collect data manually from their webinars, which would take hours, if not days, to complete. This integration automates the entire process, and data is made available in real-time.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, businesses are now able to gain a more complete understanding of their attendees, making it easier for them to optimize the content and structure of their webinars. For instance, if a business notices that a significant number of attendees drop off at a particular point in the webinar, they can use this data to understand the reason for the drop and make changes to the content and structure to prevent this in future webinars.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Google Big Query and GoTo Webinar creates a powerful tool, which assists businesses in making data-driven decisions about their webinars and online events. By automating the collection of data from webinars, businesses can save both time and resources, while obtaining real-time insights that help optimize future planning, improve audience engagement and create better experiences. </p>
