The API allows you to programmatically manage your webinars and send notifications when certain events occur, such as when a webinar starts or ends. The SDK, on the other hand, is a software development kit that enables you to build custom applications that interact with GoTo Webinar and Amazon SNS.</p>
    <p>One of the main problems the integration between GoTo Webinar and Amazon SNS solved is the ability to keep attendees informed about upcoming webinars. By integrating GoTo Webinar and Amazon SNS, you can automatically send notifications to attendees about upcoming webinars, ensuring that they don't miss important events. Another problem the integration solved is the ability to track webinar attendance.

    <p>In conclusion, integrating GoTo Webinar and Amazon SNS is a powerful combination that can help businesses manage their webinars more efficiently and keep attendees informed.
