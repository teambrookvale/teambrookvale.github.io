	<p>Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service that can turn written content into spoken audio. Amazon S3 is a cloud-based storage service that can provide secure and scalable storage for different types of data.</p>

	<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>
	<p>Amazon Polly and Amazon S3 can be integrated through the use of an API or an SDK. With either approach, developers can create custom applications that use Amazon Polly to generate spoken audio and store it securely in Amazon S3.</p>

	<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon Polly and Amazon S3 solves two key problems. Firstly, it allows developers to easily create and store audio content without needing to maintain their own infrastructure. This can significantly reduce the development time and cost required for creating audio content.</p>

	<p>Secondly, the integration provides a scalable and secure solution for storing audio files. Amazon S3 can automatically scale to match demand, ensuring that storage needs are always met. Additionally, Amazon S3 provides robust security features to protect against unauthorized access to audio files.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The integration of Amazon Polly and Amazon S3 is an excellent solution for developers looking to create and store audio content without needing to maintain their own infrastructure.
