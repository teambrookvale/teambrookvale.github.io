The APIs allow developers to connect Magento with Amazon SES for sending and receiving emails, while the SDKs offer a set of tools and resources that make integration straightforward and seamless. Various Amazon SES Magento extensions are available in the Magento marketplace for a simplified integration process, and some are free to use.</p>
