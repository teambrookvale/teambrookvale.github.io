	<h1>How Integration of BigCommerce and Instagram Lead Ads Solves Business Problems</h1>

    <p>BigCommerce is an ecommerce platform that allows businesses to create online stores. Instagram Lead Ads, on the other hand, is a marketing tool that helps businesses generate leads on Instagram. Both are powerful tools on their own, but when integrated together, they become even more effective at solving business problems.</p>

    <h2>Integration of BigCommerce and Instagram Lead Ads</h2>

    <p>The integration of BigCommerce and Instagram Lead Ads can be done through API or SDK. With the integration, businesses can create lead forms on Instagram that integrate with their BigCommerce store. When a user fills out the lead form on Instagram, their information is sent straight to the businessâ€™s BigCommerce store, making it faster and easier to follow up with potential customers.</p>

    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>

    <h3>Problem 1: Low conversion rates on Instagram</h3>
    <p>Instagram is a great platform for marketing, but getting users to convert into customers can be a challenge. With the integration of BigCommerce and Instagram Lead Ads, businesses can create a seamless user experience and make it easier for users to buy their products. This can lead to higher conversion rates and more sales.</p>

    <h3>Problem 2: Slow follow-up with leads</h3>
