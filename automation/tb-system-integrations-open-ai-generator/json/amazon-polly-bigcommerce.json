By adding voice capabilities to their online store, businesses can cater to customers with visual impairments and other disabilities who may find it difficult to navigate a website with just text and images. This also enhances the overall user experience as customers can interact with the website in a more natural and engaging way.</p>\n        \n        <p>Another problem this integration solves is improving customer engagement.
