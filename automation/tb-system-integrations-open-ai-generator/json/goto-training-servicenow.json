Both tools are essential when it comes to improving organizational efficiency and effectiveness. However, integrating the two platforms can improve the functionality and solve a plethora of business problems.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Integration of GoTo Training and ServiceNow using API or SDK</h2>\n\n\t<p>By integrating GoTo Training and ServiceNow, companies can ensure that their ITSM practices are more adept and functional. Without integration, companies need to manually handle all tasks, including adding or removing users from GoTo Training, managing training schedules, sending reminders, and so on.

IT staff can spend more time focusing on other critical tasks, increasing productivity.</p>\n\n\t<p>The integration can happen via API or SDK. An API enables the two platforms to share data seamlessly. On the other hand, an SDK provides developers with the tools and resources needed to create custom integrations between the two platforms. This means that developers can build tailor-made solutions that precisely meet the needs of their organizations.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\n\t<p>There are several problems that this integration can solve.
