Amazon SES, on the other hand, is a cloud-based email sending service that provides reliable and scalable email infrastructure for businesses of all sizes. By integrating Magento 2.X with Amazon SES, merchants can send emails to their customers in a more efficient and cost-effective way.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>\n\t<p>Both Magento 2.X and Amazon SES offer APIs and SDKs that developers can use to integrate the two platforms. The APIs allow developers to programmatically send emails from within Magento 2.X, while the SDKs provide pre-built libraries and code samples that can be used to simplify the integration process.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\t<p>Prior to this integration, merchants faced several challenges when sending emails from within Magento 2.X. For example, emails may get flagged as spam due to poor deliverability, or the sender's reputation may be negatively affected if the emails are sent from a shared IP address. Additionally, some merchants had to rely on third-party email service providers, which could be costly and still result in poor deliverability. By integrating Magento 2.X with Amazon SES, merchants can address these issues and benefit from high deliverability rates, improved email reputation, and cost savings.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\t<p>The integration of Magento 2.X with Amazon SES is a powerful solution that helps merchants improve their email delivery rates and saves them money on email marketing campaigns. Using the APIs or SDKs provided by both platforms, developers can easily integrate the two and take advantage of Amazon SES's reliable email infrastructure. As such, this integration is highly recommended for Magento 2.X store owners to ensure that they are able to effectively communicate with their customers through email.</p>\n</body>\n</html>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
