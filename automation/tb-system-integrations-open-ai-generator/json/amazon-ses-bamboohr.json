For instance, whenever a candidate applies for a job, BambooHR can automatically send a confirmation email through Amazon SES, informing the candidate that the application was received and is under review.</p>\n\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\t<p>The integration of Amazon SES and BambooHR can solve various problems for businesses, such as:\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Manually sending transactional emails consumes a lot of time and has a higher risk of errors.
