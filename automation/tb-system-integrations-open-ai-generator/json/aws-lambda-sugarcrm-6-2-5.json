Developers can write code in languages such as Node.js, Python, and Java, and run it on AWS Lambda without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.</p>\n\n\t<h2>What is SugarCRM 6.2-5?</h2>\n\t<p>SugarCRM 6.2-5 is a customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps businesses manage their customer interactions, sales, and marketing campaigns. It provides a suite of tools for managing customer data, sales opportunities, and customer support.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>\n\t<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and SugarCRM 6.2-5 can be done using their respective APIs or SDKs. With the SugarCRM REST API, developers can access and update customer information, create leads, and manage sales opportunities. The AWS SDKs provide a set of libraries and tools for developers to integrate their applications with AWS services, including AWS Lambda.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\t<p>Integrating AWS Lambda and SugarCRM 6.2-5 provides businesses with a number of benefits. Firstly, it allows developers to create event-driven workflows that automate business processes.

This reduces the need for manual intervention, ensuring that leads are followed up in a timely manner.</p>\n\n\t<p>Secondly, the integration allows businesses to scale their operations without having to manage infrastructure. AWS Lambda automatically scales to meet demand, ensuring that applications are always available. This allows businesses to focus on their core competencies, rather than spending time and resources on infrastructure management.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\t<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and SugarCRM 6.2-5 provides businesses with a powerful toolset for automating their business processes and scaling their operations.
