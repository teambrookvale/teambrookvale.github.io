This integration can be done by using a ready-made integration software or by developing a custom integration using API or SDK. The SDK is essentially a set of tools, libraries, and APIs that developers can use to create integrations while the API serves as the interface between two systems.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t<section>\n\t\t\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Combining the two systems can offer businesses a lot of benefits. Firstly, it can help businesses save time by automatically synchronizing data between the two systems. This saves employees' time and minimizes human error. Secondly, it can help businesses avoid data silos. When data is isolated in separate systems, it is hard to get a full view of the business's operations. Integrating both systems ensures that there is centralized data that can be accessed from either system.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</main>\n\t<footer>\n\t\t<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\t\t<p>Integrating MySQL and BambooHR through API or SDK is a worthwhile investment for businesses that need to manage their HR data effectively.
