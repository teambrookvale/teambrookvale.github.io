This integration allows businesses to easily create and manage training sessions for their Upwork-hired freelancers, and also allows freelancers to access the training materials and resources they need to complete their tasks.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe integration of Upwork and GoTo Training solves a number of problems for businesses and freelancers alike. One obvious benefit is increased productivity and efficiency. Freelancers who are well-trained and knowledgeable of their tasks are more likely to deliver high-quality work in a timely manner.

With this integration, businesses can provide freelancers with training sessions on a large scale and can also track their progress in real-time. This saves businesses significant amounts of money that would have otherwise been spent on hiring trainers or resources for individual freelancers.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe integration of Upwork and GoTo Training is a powerful tool for businesses that rely heavily on freelance talent to grow and scale their operations.
