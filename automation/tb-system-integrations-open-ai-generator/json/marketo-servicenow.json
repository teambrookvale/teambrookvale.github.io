By using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or SDKs (Software Development Kits), developers can create connections between different software applications and allow them to work seamlessly together.</p>\n\n  <p>The integration of Marketo and ServiceNow is no exception. By using Marketo's REST APIs or SDKs, you can pull data from Marketo into ServiceNow, and vice versa. This means that marketing teams can see how their campaigns are impacting the overall business, and IT teams can provide more effective support by understanding the customer journey more deeply.</p>\n\n  <h2>The Problems It Solves</h2>\n  \n  <p>There are several problems that this integration solves:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Information Silos:</strong> When marketing and IT teams are working in separate tools, it can be difficult to share information and collaborate effectively. By integrating Marketo and ServiceNow, teams can share data more easily and work together more closely.</li>\n    <li><strong>Low Visibility:</strong> Without a full view of the customer journey, it can be difficult to provide effective support or make informed marketing decisions. By integrating Marketo and ServiceNow, teams get a more comprehensive view of customer interactions.</li>\n    <li><strong>Manual Processes:</strong> Without automation, it can be time-consuming and error-prone to transfer data between different systems.
