Greenhouse, on the other hand, is a popular applicant tracking system used by many businesses. By integrating the two through API or SDK, businesses can streamline their recruitment process and reach a wider pool of qualified candidates. \n\t</p>\n\n\t<h2>Instagram Custom Audiences</h2>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tInstagram Custom Audiences is a feature that allows businesses to target their ads to specific groups of people. This is done by uploading a list of email addresses, phone numbers, or Instagram user IDs to create a custom audience. Once the custom audience is created, businesses can create ads that will only be shown to individuals who are a part of that audience. This feature is especially useful for retargeting individuals who have already engaged with your brand in some way, such as through a website visit or previous purchase. \n\t</p>\n\n\t<h2>Greenhouse</h2>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tGreenhouse is an applicant tracking system that helps businesses manage their recruitment process. With Greenhouse, businesses can create job postings, receive applications and resumes, and track candidates through the hiring process. Greenhouse also offers tools for scheduling interviews and communicating with candidates. \n\t</p>\n\n\t<h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tBy integrating Instagram Custom Audiences with Greenhouse through API or SDK, businesses can take advantage of the power of both tools to streamline their hiring process. For example, a business could create a custom audience from a list of email addresses collected through the Greenhouse system.
