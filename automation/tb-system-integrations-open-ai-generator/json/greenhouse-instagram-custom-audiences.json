On the other hand, Instagram Custom Audiences is an advertising feature that allows businesses to target their ads to a specific group of users based on their previous interactions with the brand.</p>\n\n\t<p>By integrating Greenhouse with Instagram Custom Audiences through API or SDK, companies can take advantage of the rich data available in their ATS to create more targeted ad campaigns on Instagram.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>\n\n\t<p>API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of rules that allow two different applications to communicate with each other. SDK stands for Software Development Kit, which is a set of tools and libraries that developers can use to build applications that integrate with a specific platform.</p>\n\n\t<p>Both Greenhouse and Instagram provide APIs and SDKs that developers can use to seamlessly connect the two platforms. With this integration, companies can automatically create custom audiences on Instagram based on the data available in their Greenhouse account.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\n\t<p>One of the main problems that this integration solves is the ability to create more targeted ad campaigns on Instagram. By leveraging the data available in Greenhouse, companies can create custom audiences on Instagram that are more likely to engage with their ads. This can lead to higher conversion rates and a better return on investment (ROI) for their advertising spend.</p>\n\n\t<p>Another problem that this integration solves is the manual effort required to keep their audience lists up to date. Without this integration, companies would have to manually upload their audience lists to Instagram on a regular basis. This can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially for larger companies with a high volume of applicants.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\t<p>Integrating Greenhouse with Instagram Custom Audiences through API or SDK can provide companies with valuable insights into their hiring process that they can leverage to create more effective ad campaigns on Instagram. By automating the process of creating custom audiences, companies can save time and reduce errors, leading to a better ROI for their advertising spend.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
