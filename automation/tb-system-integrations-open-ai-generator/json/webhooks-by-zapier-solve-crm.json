Zapier's API gives developers the ability to integrate their web applications with Zapier, resulting in a highly customized automation experience. Webhooks and API integration between Zapier and Solve CRM allows for seamless synchronization of data such as leads, contact records, and opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>SDk Integration (like Solve's SDK for .Net) enhances these capabilities and allows even more control over the data that passes between the two systems.
