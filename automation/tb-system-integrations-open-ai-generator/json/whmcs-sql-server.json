SQL Server, on the other hand, is a powerful relational database management system developed by Microsoft. Integrating these two systems can be achieved through the use of API or SDK.</p>\n\t<h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>\n\t<p>WHMCS provides a powerful API that can be used to integrate with SQL Server. The API allows WHMCS to communicate with external systems, like SQL Server, and make requests for data. The response from SQL Server can then be used to update data in WHMCS. The SDK, on the other hand, provides a set of tools and resources for developers to build custom solutions that integrate with WHMCS and SQL Server.</p>\n\t<h2>Problems Solved by Integration</h2>\n\t<p>Integrating WHMCS with SQL Server can solve a variety of problems faced by web hosting companies. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Automated Billing:</strong> WHMCS can be integrated with SQL Server to automate the billing process. This means that invoices can be generated and sent automatically, reducing the workload on staff.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Improved Data Accuracy:</strong> Integrating WHMCS with SQL Server can help to improve data accuracy. By using SQL Server as the backend database, it is possible to ensure that data is stored in a consistent and accurate manner.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Streamlined Client Management:</strong> By integrating WHMCS with SQL Server, it is possible to streamline client management.
