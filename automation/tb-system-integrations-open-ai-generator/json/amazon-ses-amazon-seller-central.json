It allows sellers to list their products, manage inventory, and track orders.</p>\n\t<p>Integrating Amazon SES with Seller Central can be done through the use of API or SDK. This integration allows sellers to send automatic emails to their customers, such as order confirmation and shipment notifications, directly from their Seller Central account using Amazon SES.
