One of the solutions that businesses can benefit from is integrating different systems together. By doing so, they can drastically reduce manual data entry and automate a wide range of tasks.</p>\n\n<h2>What is AWS Lambda?</h2>\n\n<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It enables users to develop microservices, process data feeds, and automate tasks, among other things.</p>\n\n<h2>What is SugarCRM 7+?</h2>\n\n<p>SugarCRM 7+, on the other hand, is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that empowers businesses to better manage their customer interactions, data, and communications. It is a web-based platform that can be customized to fit specific business needs.</p>\n\n<h2>Integration of the Two Through API or SDK</h2>\n\n<p>Fortunately, integrating AWS Lambda and SugarCRM 7+ is not as difficult as it may seem. There are two ways to achieve this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>API integration:</strong> This involves connecting AWS Lambda to SugarCRM 7+ via the application programming interface (API). With this approach, developers can specify the data that they want to be transferred between the two systems.</li>\n    <li><strong>SDK integration:</strong> With this method, developers can use an AWS software development kit (SDK) to interact with SugarCRM 7+. This approach is beneficial when integrating AWS Lambda with SugarCRM 7+ servers that are not publically accessible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Problems Their Integration Solves</h2>\n\n<p>Integrating AWS Lambda and SugarCRM 7+ solves many problems that businesses face. For instance, they can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Automate the process of updating customer and lead information on SugarCRM 7+.</li>\n    <li>Automatically add new leads to the CRM database.</li>\n    <li>Send automatic follow-up emails to leads that meet specific criteria.</li>\n    <li>Automatically update records when a sale is closed or a contract is signed.</li>\n    <li>Trigger AWS Lambda functions when a specific activity occurs within SugarCRM 7+, such as when a new lead is assigned to a sales representative.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>The integration of AWS Lambda and SugarCRM 7+ provides businesses with an efficient and effective way to streamline processes and focus their attention on what truly matters: their customers. By reducing manual data entry and automating tasks, businesses can improve their productivity and bottom line.</p>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
