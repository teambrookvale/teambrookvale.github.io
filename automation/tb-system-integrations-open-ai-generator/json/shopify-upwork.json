This integration saves time and eliminates the need for a manual process for hiring talent and completing Shopify projects.</p>\n\n\t<p>The Upwork-Shopify integration solves a lot of problems that businesses face.

This integration also simplifies billing as Shopify merchants can have their billing synced with Upwork which results in convenient and streamlined payment and billing. Freelancers can also review and track their work hours and get prompt payments through their Upwork account.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\t<p>The integration of Shopify and Upwork brings convenience and simplicity to merchants and freelancers alike.
