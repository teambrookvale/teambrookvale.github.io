It allows you to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. You can use CloudWatch to gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.</p>\n\n<h2>Amazon SNS</h2>\n<p>Amazon SNS is a messaging and notification service for AWS cloud. It allows you to manage mobile app notifications, email notifications, and SMS messages. You can use SNS to send messages or notifications to multiple recipients, and you can also use it to trigger events in other AWS services.</p>\n\n<h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>\n<p>The integration of Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon SNS allows you to be notified of changes in your AWS environment, and to receive alerts when metrics exceed your specified thresholds. You can set up alarms in CloudWatch to publish to SNS topics, and then subscribe to those topics to receive notifications. You can also use AWS SDKs to automate the creation of alarms and topics, and to manage subscriptions, publishers, and notifications.</p>\n\n<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n<p>The integration of Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon SNS solves some common problems in cloud monitoring and alerting. Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>You want to monitor the availability of an EC2 instance, and receive an email notification if it goes down.</li>\n    <li>You want to monitor CPU usage on all your instances, and receive an SMS notification if it exceeds 90%.</li>\n    <li>You want to monitor a CloudFront distribution, and receive an email notification if the percentage of 4xx errors exceeds 5%.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The integration of Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon SNS makes it easy to monitor and alert on changes in your AWS environment. You can set up alarms and notifications for a wide range of metrics, and receive alerts via email, SMS, or other channels. This integration helps you ensure the availability and performance of your AWS resources, and can help you detect and respond to issues quickly.</p>\n</body>\n</html>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
