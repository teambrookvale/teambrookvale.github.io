This integration can be set up through the Amazon CloudFront console or programmatically using the AWS SDK.</p>\n\n\t\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\t\t<p>The integration of Amazon CloudFront and Amazon SQS provides several benefits for organizations:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Reduced latency and improved performance by serving content from edge locations closer to end-users and minimizing the travel distance of messages between microservices.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Improved scalability and reliability by distributing the workload across multiple edge locations and processing messages asynchronously and independently without affecting the overall system performance.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Enhanced monitoring and analysis by collecting and storing real-time data about cache usage, invalidation requests, and message traffic in Amazon CloudFront and Amazon SQS logs for further analysis and optimization.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\t\t<p>The integration of Amazon CloudFront and Amazon SQS is a powerful solution for delivering high-quality web content and improving the performance and scalability of distributed applications and microservices. It provides organizations with a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solution for deploying and managing their content delivery network and message queueing systems. </p>\n\t</main>\n\t<footer>\n\t\t<p>Copyright \u00a9 2021.
