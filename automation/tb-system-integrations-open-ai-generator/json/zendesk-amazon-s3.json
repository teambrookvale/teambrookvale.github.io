An SDK is a set of development tools that allows developers to create applications that work with a specific software system. For example, you can use the AWS SDK to integrate Amazon S3 into your Zendesk support system.</p>\n\n\n\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\n\t<p>The integration of Zendesk and Amazon S3 can solve several problems for businesses.

Since Amazon S3 offers scalable, secure, and reliable cloud storage, businesses can ensure that their customer data is safe and readily accessible, allowing for faster issue resolution and better customer satisfaction.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\t<p>In conclusion, the integration of Zendesk and Amazon S3 through API or SDK is an excellent solution for businesses looking to streamline their customer support operations.
