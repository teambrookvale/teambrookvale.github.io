Whereas, ServiceNow provides a leading cloud platform to manage digital workflows. Integrating Google Big Query with ServiceNow helps organizations in gaining better insights, automating workflows, and enhancing their decision-making processes. In this blog post, we\u2019ll discuss how these two powerful solutions can be integrated through API or SDK and what problems their integration solves.</p>\n\n<h2>Integration of Google Big Query and ServiceNow</h2>\n\n<p>Integration between Google Big Query and ServiceNow allows you to bring data from Google\u2019s cloud data warehouse to ServiceNow to perform further analysis or make critical decisions. This integration can be performed in two ways \u2013 by using an API or SDK.</p>\n\n<h3>API Integration</h3>\n\n<p>To integrate Google Big Query with ServiceNow via API, follow these simple steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Generate an API key in Google Cloud Console.</li>\n    <li>Use the Google Big Query API web service to fetch data from Google Big Query.</li>\n    <li>Use the ServiceNow REST API to post data in ServiceNow tables.</li>\n    <li>Schedule API calls for updating data periodically.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>SDK Integration</h3>\n\n<p>Using ServiceNow\u2019s Platform APIs and Google Big Query\u2019s software development kit (SDK), organizations can create connectors between Google Big Query and ServiceNow instantly. This integration is faster, more reliable, and easier to maintain as compared to API integration.</p>\n\n<h2>Problems Google Big Query and ServiceNow Integration Solves</h2>\n\n<p>Integrating Google Big Query with ServiceNow solves the following problems:</p>\n\n<h3>Enhanced Decision-Making Processes</h3>\n\n<p>By integrating Google Big Query with ServiceNow, organizations can fetch real-time data from Google\u2019s cloud data warehouse to ServiceNow. This enables stakeholders and decision-makers to gain better insights, making data-driven decisions that improve the organizational bottom line.</p>\n\n<h3>Automated Workflows</h3>\n\n<p>Organizations can automate workflows by creating triggers and using ServiceNow\u2019s automation features. For instance, if a new record is added to a ServiceNow table, a trigger automatically sends the data to Google Big Query. Similarly, a trigger can be configured in Google Big Query to send data automatically to ServiceNow tables. This automation ensures that critical data is always updated on time for organizational use.</p>\n\n<h3>Improved Collaboration</h3>\n\n<p>With Google Big Query and ServiceNow integrated, stakeholders from different departments can collaborate and work together on data analysis and decision-making processes. This improves communication and reduces the chances of data silos in the organization. Integration allows stakeholders to work in a unified environment and improves the overall organizational output.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Google Big Query and ServiceNow are powerful solutions that provide a host of benefits to organizations looking to streamline their workflows and decision-making processes. Integrating Google Big Query with ServiceNow through API or SDK enables stakeholders to gain better insights, automate workflows, and improve collaboration among different departments. This integration brings together two leading solutions that can take the organization to new heights of success.</p>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
