Lambda allows you to run your code without having to\n      manage any servers, while CloudFront provides a global content delivery\n      network that delivers your content to end users with low latency and high\n      transfer speeds.\n    </p>\n    <h2>AWS Lambda</h2>\n    <p>\n      AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run your\n      code without having to manage any servers. You only pay for the compute time\n      that you consume, and Lambda scales automatically to handle thousands of\n      requests per second. Lambda supports many programming languages including\n      Node.js, Python, Java, and C#.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Amazon CloudFront</h2>\n    <p>\n      Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that serves your\n      content from a global network of edge locations. CloudFront delivers your\n      content with low latency and high transfer speeds by detecting the location\n      of the end user and dynamically routing requests to the nearest available\n      edge location. CloudFront also provides security features like SSL/TLS\n      encryption and access control.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Integration through API or SDK</h2>\n    <p>\n      You can integrate AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudFront using the\n      CloudFront-triggered Lambda edge function. The CloudFront-triggered Lambda\n      edge function allows you to execute custom logic on incoming requests to\n      CloudFront edge locations. You can write your own Lambda code to modify the\n      request or response headers, generate dynamic content, or authenticate\n      users.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You can also use the AWS SDKs to interact with both AWS Lambda and Amazon\n      CloudFront programmatically. The SDKs are available in many programming\n      languages and allow you to easily create, deploy, and manage Lambda\n      functions and CloudFront distributions.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n    <p>\n      The integration of AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudFront can solve several\n      problems for developers. First, it allows you to create serverless\n      applications that can handle high traffic and provide low latency to end\n      users. Second, it provides a scalable and reliable way to run your code\n      without having to manage any servers. Third, it allows you to easily\n      modify incoming requests and responses to CloudFront edge locations with\n      custom logic.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>\n      The integration of AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudFront provides a powerful\n      way to create scalable and reliable serverless applications with low\n      latency and high availability. The CloudFront-triggered Lambda edge\n      function and the AWS SDKs provide developers with the tools they need to\n      easily create, deploy, and manage Lambda functions and CloudFront\n      distributions. By leveraging these technologies, developers can focus on\n      writing code instead of managing servers, and deliver fast and reliable\n      content to end users around the globe.\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
