It uses advanced deep learning technologies, like deep neural networks, to generate speech that sounds like a human voice. On the other hand, SQL Server is a popular database management system used by many organizations.</p>\n\n\t<p>The integration of Amazon Polly with SQL Server can be done through API or SDK. With this integration, users can store text data in their SQL Server database and use Amazon Polly to convert that data into speech. This integration facilitates the ability for users to generate speech for their applications, websites, or other online content without having to record audio files or hire voice actors.</p>\n\n\t<p>This integration also solves several problems faced by users. For instance, it enables users with visual impairments to access information through hearing rather than relying on reading. Also, it enhances user experience by providing an audio option for content that is usually presented in a visual format. Moreover, it reduces costs and time associated with creating and maintaining audio files.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\t<p>Integrating Amazon Polly with SQL Server is a great way to add a text-to-speech feature to your applications or websites. This integration allows users to store text data in SQL Server and generate speech using Amazon Polly. This improves accessibility, user experience, and reduces costs associated with creating and maintaining audio files.</p>\n</body>\n</html>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
