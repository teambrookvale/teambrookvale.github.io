Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service that allows developers to integrate natural-sounding speech into their applications. But what happens when you combine these two services? </p>\n\t<p>The integration of Facebook Custom Audiences and Amazon Polly through API or SDK allows advertisers to create more engaging ads by incorporating audio rather than just visual elements. Polly's lifelike voice can read out the ad text, making it more accessible for people who may have difficulty reading or are in a situation where they cannot view the ad visually (such as while driving).</p>\n\t<p>Furthermore, this integration allows advertisers to create audio ads in multiple languages with ease. You can simply enter the ad text in the desired language and Polly will generate speech in that language.</p>\n\t<p>Another benefit of this integration is that it can help advertisers reach a wider audience. By creating audio ads, they can target people who may not use Facebook often but still listen to music or podcasts on their device.</p>\n\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\t<p>The integration of Facebook Custom Audiences and Amazon Polly provides a unique and effective way for advertisers to reach their desired audience. By incorporating audio into their ads, they can make them more engaging and accessible. Additionally, the ability to create ads in multiple languages can help them reach a wider audience. Overall, this integration serves as a great example of how different technologies can work together to create new opportunities for businesses.</p>\n</body>\n</html>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
