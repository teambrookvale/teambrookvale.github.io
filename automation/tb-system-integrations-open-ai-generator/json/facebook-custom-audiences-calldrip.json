It is a targeted advertising solution that allows businesses to reach people who have already engaged with their brand, such as by visiting their website, signing up for their mailing list, or downloading their app.</p>\n\n    <h2>Calldrip</h2>\n    <p>Calldrip, on the other hand, is a customer relationship management (CRM) tool that complements Facebook Custom Audiences. It helps businesses manage their leads and increase their conversions by allowing them to immediately respond to phone calls.</p>\n\n    <h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>\n    <p>The integration of Facebook Custom Audiences and Calldrip through API or SDK is beneficial to businesses in several ways. First, it allows businesses to respond more quickly to leads who call after seeing their Facebook ads. Businesses can track the calls made as a result of Facebook ads and use the data obtained to improve their advertising strategy.</p>\n\n    <p>Secondly, it gives businesses the ability to keep their customer information up to date. By syncing customer information from Facebook to Calldrip, businesses can keep track of their customer's phone numbers, email addresses, and other critical information. This enables them to personalize their communication and provide better customer service.</p>\n\n    <h2>Problems their Integration Solves</h2>\n    <p>The integration of Facebook Custom Audiences and Calldrip has solved several problems that businesses face.

When customer information is stored in different locations, it can be challenging to keep it up to date.
