Integrating these two platforms through API or SDK can bring a lot of benefits to your workflow and make your recruitment process much more efficient.</p>\n\t<h2>What is Amazon EC2?</h2>\n\t<p>Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. With EC2, you can quickly launch new instances of your applications, scale up or down as needed, and pay only for the compute power you use.</p>\n\t<h2>What is Greenhouse?</h2>\n\t<p>Greenhouse is a cloud-based ATS that helps companies source, interview, and hire the best talent. This platform is designed to streamline your recruiting process by providing a comprehensive solution for identifying, recruiting, and hiring the most qualified candidates.</p>\n\t<h2>Integration of Amazon EC2 and Greenhouse through API or SDK</h2>\n\t<p>One of the biggest benefits of integrating Amazon EC2 and Greenhouse is the ability to automatically transfer candidate data from Greenhouse to EC2. This can save recruiters a lot of time and reduce the risk of errors or data loss. Some of the key features of this integration include:</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Automatic transfer of candidate data from Greenhouse to EC2</li>\n\t\t<li>Seamless integration with other tools and applications</li>\n\t\t<li>Customizable workflows based on your requirements</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<p>To integrate Amazon EC2 and Greenhouse, you can use either API or SDK. The API method allows you to directly access and manipulate data from the EC2 and Greenhouse platforms. The SDK method provides pre-built libraries and tools for developers to quickly integrate the two platforms into their workflows. Both methods are designed to be flexible and easy to use.</p>\n\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\t<p>Integrating Amazon EC2 and Greenhouse can solve many problems that recruiters face on a daily basis.
