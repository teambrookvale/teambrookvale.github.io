While CRM works to improve customer interactions and improve company relationships with customers, SQL Server keeps a record of important company data. However, it can be quite challenging to sync data between the two systems effectively without an API or SDK.</p>\n\n\t\t<h2>Solve CRM</h2>\n\t\t<p>Solve CRM is an excellent cloud-based CRM solution designed for small and medium-sized enterprise businesses with customizable features for its users.

SQL Server allows companies to organize data, run analytics, and manage data securely. </p>\n\n\t\t<h2>Integration of the Two through API or SDK</h2>\n\t\t<p>API and SDK are used to link these two systems. Through API or SDK integration, data sharing between CRM and SQL is real-time and highly efficient.

The integration also provides solutions to fragmented and inconsistent data. With integration, data transfer is streamlined into a single database, thus increasing accuracy, consistency and time-efficiency. </p>\n\n\t\t<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\t\t<p>CRM and SQL Server are vital business tools that every corporation needs. However, the ability to integrate the two allows for businesses to have an efficient, real-time and effortless exchange of data. API or SDK integration of CRM and SQL Server provides solutions to fragmented, inconsistent data and reduces human errors and time invested in manual data transfer.
