These two services can be integrated using API or SDK, and this integration can solve a number of problems for businesses.</p>\n\n\t<h2>What is Google Ads?</h2>\n\t<p>Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords, is an advertising platform developed by Google. It allows businesses to create and display ads on Google's search engine and other websites that are part of the Google Display Network. Advertisers can create text ads, image ads, video ads, and various other types of ads on this platform.</p>\n\n\t<h2>What is Amazon CloudFront?</h2>\n\t<p>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network offered by AWS. It caches content, such as images, videos, and web pages, and delivers it to users from the nearest server location. This reduces latency and improves the user experience. It can also distribute content to a global audience through multiple edge locations.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Integration of Google Ads and Amazon CloudFront</h2>\n\t<p>The integration of Google Ads and Amazon CloudFront can be achieved using APIs or SDKs provided by both platforms. By integrating these two services, businesses can benefit from faster page load times, reduced latency, and improved user experience. Ads served through Google Ads will have faster load times when hosted on CloudFront, which can lead to higher click-through rates and conversions.</p>\n\n\t<h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n\t<p>The integration of Google Ads and Amazon CloudFront can solve several problems that businesses face. One of the major problems is slow page load times, which can drive away potential customers. By caching content on CloudFront and delivering it from the nearest edge location, businesses can reduce latency and improve the user experience. This can lead to higher engagement and better conversion rates.</p>\n\n\t<p>Another problem that businesses face is the cost of hosting content.
