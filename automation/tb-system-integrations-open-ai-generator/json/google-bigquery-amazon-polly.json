It allows you to run SQL-like queries over large datasets in seconds, and explore and visualize your data in real-time. </p>\n    \n    <p>Amazon Polly, on the other hand, is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, using advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize human-like speech patterns. It currently supports over 60 languages and a wide range of voices, accents and emotion expressions. </p>\n    \n    <h2>Integration of the two through API or SDK</h2>\n    \n    <p>Integrating Google BigQuery and Amazon Polly can bring natural language processing capabilities to your data analysis workflows. For example, you can use Amazon Polly to generate speech from your BigQuery query results, and then use this audio output for various purposes such as audio books, podcasts, automated phone greetings, and so on.</p>\n    \n    <p>To integrate the two services, you can either use the Amazon Polly API or SDK, which provides a set of RESTful APIs for generating speech and managing voices, or the Google BigQuery API or SDK, which provides a set of RESTful APIs for managing datasets, tables, and queries.</p>\n    \n    <h2>Problems their integration solves</h2>\n    \n    <p>The integration of Google BigQuery and Amazon Polly offers several solutions for different problems, such as:</p>\n    \n    <ul>\n      <li>Creating audio books from BigQuery data: You can use Amazon Polly to directly create audio books from your BigQuery data, and distribute them through various channels.</li>\n      <li>Creating podcasts from BigQuery data: You can use Amazon Polly to generate speech from your BigQuery query results, and then use this audio output to create engaging podcast episodes.</li>\n      <li>Creating automated phone greetings from BigQuery data: You can use Amazon Polly to generate personalized voice greetings or messages based on your BigQuery data, and use this audio output for your call center or customer service line.</li>\n    </ul>\n    \n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    \n    <p>The integration of Google BigQuery and Amazon Polly offers a powerful solution for natural language processing, by providing an easy way to generate speech from large datasets and distribute it through various channels. It also provides a cost-effective solution for creating automated voice applications that can significantly improve customer service experiences and engagement.</p>\n    \n  </body>\n</html>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
