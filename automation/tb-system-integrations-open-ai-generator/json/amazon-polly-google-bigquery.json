It uses advanced deep learning techniques to provide natural-sounding speech. Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics platform. It can process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.</p>\n    \n    <p>By integrating Amazon Polly and Google BigQuery through API or SDK, users can automatically generate spoken summaries of their data reports. For example, a user could run a SQL query in Google BigQuery to analyze customer feedback, and then use Amazon Polly to generate an audio summary of the results.</p>\n    \n    <p>This integration solves several problems. Firstly, it saves time and effort for users who would otherwise need to manually summarize their data reports. Secondly, it provides accessibility benefits for visually impaired users who may prefer an audio summary. Finally, it can improve overall understanding and retention of the data by users who may benefit from hearing the information spoken aloud.</p>\n    \n    <h2>Getting Started</h2>\n    \n    <p>To get started with integrating Amazon Polly and Google BigQuery, users will need to have accounts set up for both services. They will also need to select a programming language and choose the appropriate SDK or API to use for integration.</p>\n    \n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    \n    <p>The integration of Amazon Polly and Google BigQuery through API or SDK offers a powerful tool for users looking to summarize their data reports quickly and efficiently. By automating the process of generating spoken summaries, users can save valuable time and effort while making their data more accessible and understandable to a wider audience. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
