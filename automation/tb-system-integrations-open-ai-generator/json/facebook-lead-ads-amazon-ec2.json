By allowing users to easily fill out a form within the Facebook platform, businesses can capture contact information and other valuable data from potential customers. Amazon EC2, on the other hand, is a popular cloud computing service that provides businesses with scalable computing capacity and easy-to-use tools for managing it. </p>\n\n\t<p>The integration of Facebook Lead Ads with Amazon EC2 through API or SDK allows businesses to capture and store leads generated from Facebook campaigns directly within the Amazon EC2 environment. This eliminates the need to manually transfer lead data between platforms, saving time and reducing the risk of errors. Additionally, the use of Amazon EC2 ensures that the lead data is securely stored and easily accessible, helping businesses to analyze and use the data to improve their marketing efforts.</p>\n\n\t<p>One of the main problems that this integration solves is the inefficiency of lead capture and storage.
